<h2>THE TRANSLATOR's PREFACE.</h2>

<p><i><span class="smcap">It</span> is not my Design, in the Task I undertake of giving some
Account of this Work, as well as of the Art which is the Subject of
it, to trace its Origin back into past Times, or to wander in search
of it in the Darkness and Confusion of remote Antiquity. Let it
suffice to say, that though its Beginning, as well as that of other
Arts, was imperfect, yet its Use, and the Entertainment it affords,
have been known and tasted in all Ages. But however distinguish'd it
may be by the Notice of the Great, who have at all Times deign'd to
profess and practise it; it is yet less entitled to our Regard for
these Distinctions, than for the real Advantages we derive from it.
Riding consists of two Parts, the</i> useful <i>and the</i> ornamental. <i>That
the latter of these may be dispensed with, is most readily granted;
but that it behoves every one who puts himself upon a Horse to have
some Knowledge of the first, is most evident.&mdash;For who would trust to
the Mercy of an Animal that may prove wild and ungovernable, who knows
himself to be incapable of controuling him, and of acting for his own
Safety? Who would venture alone into a Vessel, that can neither row,
nor manage a Sail, but must trust entirely to the Winds and Tide?
Yet is this the Case with the Generality of Mankind, who are carried
upon the Back of a Horse, and think they</i> ride. <i>The</i> Utility <i>of
this Art consists then in knowing how to guide and direct your Horse
as you please, and in reducing him to Obedience, so as to make him
execute readily what you require of him. Thus far it is to be wish'd
every Person who is conversant with Horses, would endeavour to attain.
The</i> ornamental <i>Part, I have already said, is not so requisite
to be known: It can only be called an Accomplishment, and placed
among the superfluous but refin'd Pleasures of Life. In what Esteem
and Honour however it has constantly been held, abundantly appears
from the Schools and Academies every where erected for teaching its
Elements, as well as from the Number of Books, ancient and modern,
given to the World by eminent and accomplished Persons who have
studied and practis'd it. Among these our illustrious Countryman</i>,
William Cavendish, <i>Duke of</i> Newcastle, <i>has the highest Claim to
our Praise and Acknowledgments. It would be needless to describe his
Excellencies; his Character, as a Horseman, is universally known, and
universally admir'd. The Truth and Soundness of his Principles, and
the Extensiveness of his Knowledge, have opened to us an easier, a
shorter, and more certain Way to Perfection in the Art, than was known
before. His Precepts have accordingly been adopted by all succeeding
Professors, and his Writings consider'd as the Oracle of Horsemanship,
notwithstanding a Want of Method and Exactness, which has been objected
to them. To remedy these Imperfections, is the Design of the present
Undertaking, and the Labours of a judicious and experienced Foreigner,
must consummate in the Knowledge of the Art he professes. He has
presented us with a new System of Horsemanship, extracted from the
Rules of that great Master. The Method and Conciseness with which he
has digested the Whole, have made the Copy much less than the Original,
but it is a small well-polished Gem. To speak truth, he has made
the Subject so much his own by the Refinement of his Remarks, the
Justness of his Reasoning, and the Light he has diffused through it,
that it must have the Merit of an Original; at least the Reader will
be divided to whom he shall render most Thanks, whether to him who has
given the Food, or to him who has prepar'd and set it before us with so
much Elegance and Order. This at least is our Author's Praise.&mdash;&mdash;The
Translator has endeavoured to do him as much Justice, in the following
Sheets, as he has done his great Original; sensible of the Danger of
so difficult an Enterprize, but prompted to it in hopes of making
his Merit more known. He translated the Work, that the Treasures it
contains may be gathered by those who are so unfortunate as to want
this Assistance to obtain them. He has been as faithful to his Author,
as the Languages will allow, judging that to be the surest way of doing
him Justice. In some Places however he has used (as all Translators
must) a discretionary Power. Every Art has technical terms, or Words
of its own; these he has preserved in the Translation, the</i> English
<i>affording none adequate to them. He has given no Notes or Comments,
imagining the Original can, and hoping the Translation will, want
none. Of this however his Readers will be the best Judges; he will say
no more of himself, but that he has endeavoured to make the Work as
perfect as he could; and for this Reason will be very ready to own any
Faults that may be pointed out; for, though desirous of Approbation, he
is not vain enough to think, there may not be room for Censure.</i></p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAP_I" id="CHAP_I"></a>CHAP. I.<br />
<i>Of the Horseman's Seat.</i></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1" id="Page_1">[Pg 1]</a></span>
<span class="smcap">The</span> Principles and Rules which have hitherto been given for
the Horseman's Seat, are various, and even opposite, according as
they have been adopted by different Masters, and taught in different
Countries; almost each Master, in particular, and every Nation, having
certain Rules and Notions of their own. Let us see, however, if Art can
discover nothing to us that is certain and invariably true.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> <i>Italians</i>, the <i>Spaniards</i>, the <i>French</i>, and, in a word,
every Country, where Riding is in repute, adopt each a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span> Posture which
is peculiar to themselves; the Foundation of their general Notions, is,
if I may so say, the same, but yet each Country has prescribed Rules
for the Placing of the Man in the Saddle.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> Contrariety of Opinions, which have their Origin more
in Prejudice, than in Truth and Reality, has given rise to many vain
Reasonings and Speculations, each System having its Followers; and,
as if Truth was not always the same and unchangeable, but at liberty
to assume various, and even opposite Appearances; sometimes one
Opinion prevailed, sometimes another dazzled; insomuch, that those who
understand nothing of the Subject, but yet are desirous of informing
themselves, by searching it to the Bottom, have hitherto been lost in
Doubt and Perplexity.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">There</span> is nevertheless a sure and infallible Method, by the
Assistance of which it would be very easy to overturn all these
Systems: But not to enter into a needless Detail, of the extravagant
Notions which the Seat alone has given rise to, let us trace it from
Principles by so much the more solid, as their Authority will be
supported by the most convincing and self-evident Reasons.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> order to succeed in an Art where the Mechanism of the Body
is absolutely necessary, and where each Part of the Body has proper
Functions, which are peculiar to it, it is most certain, that all and
every Part of the Body should be in a natural Posture; were they in
an imperfect Situation, they would want that Ease and Freedom which
is inseparable from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span> Grace; and as every Motion which is constrained,
being false in itself, is incapable of Justness; it is clear that the
Part so constrained and forced would throw the whole into Disorder,
because each Part belonging to, and depending upon the whole Body, and
the Body partaking of the Constraint of its Parts, can never feel that
fix'd Point, that just Counterpoise and Equilibre in which alone a fine
and just Execution consists.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is not therefore sufficient in giving Directions for the
Seat, to keep altogether to trivial and common Rules which may be
followed or left at pleasure; we ought to weigh and examine them with
Skill and Judgment, in order to know how to apply them properly and
suitably as the Shape and Figure of the Person to whom we undertake
to give a Seat will allow; for many Motions and Attitudes that appear
easy and natural in one Man, in another are awkward and ungraceful;
whence all those Faults and Difficulties which in many Persons have
been thought insuperable; whereas a little more Knowledge, a closer
Attention, and a more serious Examination into the Principles of the
Art, would convert in the same Subject an awkward and displeasing
Appearance, into an easy, natural, and graceful Figure, capable of
drawing the Eyes even of Judges themselves.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Indeed</span> the Objects, to which a Master, anxious for the
Advancement of his Pupil, should attend, are infinite. To little
Purpose will it be to keep the strictest Eye upon all the Parts and
Limbs of his Pupil's Body; in vain will he endeavour to remedy all the
Defects and Faults which are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span> found in the Posture of almost every
Scholar in the Beginning; unless he is intimately acquainted with,
and apprized of, the close Dependance and Connection that there is
between the Motions of each Part of the Body, and all the Rest; a
Correspondence caused by the reciprocal Action of the Muscles which
govern and direct them; unless therefore he is Master of this Secret,
and has this Clue to the Labyrinth, he will never attain the End he
proposes, particularly in his first Lessons, upon which the Success of
the rest always depends.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">These</span> Principles being established, let us reason in
consequence of them; we shall display them with great Force and
Clearness.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Body of a Man is divided into three Parts, two of which
are moveable, the other immoveable.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> First of the two moveable Parts is the Trunk or Body, down
to the Waist; the Second is from the Knees to the Feet; so that the
remaining immoveable Part is that between the Waist and the Knees.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Parts then which ought to be without Motion, are the Fork
or Twist of the Horseman, and his Thighs: Now, that these Parts may be
kept without Motion, they ought to have a certain Hold and Center, if I
may so say, to rest upon, which no Motion that the Horse can make, can
disturb or loosen; this Point or Center is the Basis of the Hold which
the Horseman has upon his Horse, and is what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span> is called the <i>Seat</i>.
Now, if the Seat is nothing else but this Point or Center, it must
follow, that not only the Grace, but the Symmetry and true Proportion
of the whole Attitude depends upon those Parts of the Body that are
immoveable.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Let</span> the Horseman then place himself at once upon his Twist,
sitting exactly in the Middle of the Saddle, let him support this
Posture, in which the Twist alone seems to sustain the Weight of the
whole Body, by moderately leaning upon the Buttocks; let his Thighs
be turned inward, and rest flat upon the Sides of the Saddle, and in
order to this, let the Turn of the Thighs proceed directly from the
Hips, and let him employ no Force or Strength to keep himself in the
Saddle, but trust to the Weight of his Body and Thighs; this is the
exact Equilibre; in this consists the Firmness of the whole Building;
a Firmness which young Beginners are never sensible of at first, but
which is to be acquired, and will always be attained by Exercise and
Practice.</p>

<p>I demand but a moderate Stress upon the Buttocks, because a Man that
sits full upon them, can never turn his Thighs flat upon the Saddle;
and the Thighs should always lay flat, because the fleshy Part of the
Thigh being insensible, the Horseman would not otherwise be able to
feel the Motions of his Horse. I insist that the Turn of the Thigh
should be from the Hip, because this Turn can never be natural, but as
it proceeds from the Hollow of the Hip-bone. I insist further, that the
Horseman never avail himself of the Strength or Help of his Thighs;
because, besides that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span> would then be not only less steady, but the
closer he prest them to the Saddle, the more would he be lifted above
it; and with respect to his Buttocks and Thighs, he ought always to be
in the Middle of the Saddle, and sit down full and close upon it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Having</span> thus firmly placed the immoveable Parts, let us pass
on to the first of the Moveable; which is, as I have already observed,
the Body or Trunk, as far as to the Waist: I comprehend in the Body or
Trunk, the Head, the Shoulders, the Breast, the Arms, the Hands, the
Loins, and the Waist, of the Horseman.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Head should be free, firm, and easy, in order to be ready
for all the natural Motions that the Horseman may make, in turning it
to one Side or the other: It should be firm, that is to say strait,
without leaning to the Right or Left, neither advanced, nor thrown
back; it should be easy, because if otherwise, it would occasion a
Stiffness, and that Stiffness affecting the different Parts of the
Body, especially the Back-bone, they would be without Ease, and
constrained.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Shoulders alone influence by their Motion the Breast, the
Reins, and the Waist.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Horseman should present or advance his Breast; by this his
whole Figure opens and displays itself: He should have a small Hollow
in his Loins, and should push his Waist forward to the Pommel of the
Saddle, because this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span> Position corresponds and unites him to all the
Motions of the Horse. Now, only throwing the Shoulders back produces
all these Effects, and gives them exactly in the Degree that is
requisite; whereas, if we were to look for the particular Position of
each Part separately, and by itself, without examining the Connection
that there is between the Motions of one Part with those of another,
there would be such a Bending in the Loins, that the Horseman would
be, if I may so say, <i>hollow-back'd</i>; and as from that he would force
his Breast forward, and his Waist towards the Pommel of the Saddle, he
would be flung back, and must sit upon the Rump of the Horse.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Arms should be bent at the Elbows, and the Elbows should
rest equally upon the Hips; if the Arms were strait, the Consequence
would be, that the Hands would be infinitely too low, or at much too
great a Distance from the Body; and if the Elbows were not kept steady,
they would of consequence give an Uncertainty and Fickleness to the
Hand, sufficient to ruin it for ever.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is true, that the Bridle-hand is that which absolutely
ought to be steady and immoveable, and one might conclude from hence,
that the Left-elbow only ought to rest upon the Hip, but Grace consists
in the exact Proportion and Symmetry of all the Parts of the Body,
and to have the Arm on one Side raised and advanced, and that of the
other kept down and close to the Body, would present but an awkward and
disagreeable Appearance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span><span class="smcap">It</span> is this which determines the Situation of the Hand, which
holds the Switch. The Left-hand being of an equal Height with the
Elbow, so that the Knuckle of the Little-finger, and the Tip of the
Elbow, be both in a Line; this Hand then being rounded neither too much
nor too little, but just so that the Wrist may direct all its Motions;
place your Right-hand, or the Switch-hand, lower and more forward than
the Bridle-hand; it should be lower than the other Hand, because if it
was upon a Level with it, it would restrain or obstruct its Motions;
and were it to be higher, as it cannot take so great a Compass as the
Bridle-hand, which must always be kept over against the Horseman's
Body, it is absolutely necessary to keep the Proportion of the Elbows,
that it should be lower than the other.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Legs and Feet make up the second Division, of what I call
the moveable Parts of the Body.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Legs serve for two Purposes; they may be used as Aids, or
Corrections, to the Animal. They should then be kept near the Sides of
the Horse, and in a Line with the Man's Body; for being near the Part
of the Horse's Body where his Feeling is most delicate, they are ready
to do their Office in the Instant they are wanted. Moreover, as they
are an Appendix of the Thighs, if the Thigh is upon its Flat in the
Saddle, they will, by a necessary Consequence, be turned just as they
ought, and will infallibly give the same Turn to the Feet; because the
Feet depend upon them, as they depend upon the Thighs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span><span class="smcap">The</span> Toe should be held a little higher than the Heel, for
the lower the Toe is, the nearer the Heel will be to the Sides of the
Horse, and must be in danger of touching his Flank. Many Persons,
notwithstanding, when they raise their Toe, bend and twist their
Ankle, as if they were lame in that Part. The Reason of this is very
plain; it is because they make use of the Muscles in their Legs and
Thighs; whereas, they should employ only the Joint of the Foot for
this Purpose; a Joint, given by Nature to facilitate all the Motions
of the Foot, and to enable it to turn to the Right or Left, upwards or
downwards.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Such</span> is, in short, the mechanical Disposition of all the
Parts of the Horseman's Body. I will enlarge no further upon a Subject
treated on already so amply by every Writer; as it is needless to
write what has been already handled. I have had no other Design in
this Chapter, than to give an Idea of the Correspondence that there
is between all the Parts of the Body, because it is only by a just
Knowledge of this mutual Relation of all the different Parts, that we
can be enabled to prescribe Rules for giving that true and natural
Seat, which is not only the Principle of Justness, but likewise the
Foundation of all Grace in the Horseman.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAP_II" id="CHAP_II"></a>CHAP. II.<br />
<i>Of the Hand, and its Effects.</i></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span><span class="smcap">The</span> Knowledge of the different Characters, and the different
Nature of Horses, together with the Vices, and Imperfections, as well
as the exact and just Proportions of the Parts of a Horse's Body,
is the Foundation upon which is built the Theory of our Art; but
this Theory will be unnecessary and even useless, it we are not able
likewise to carry it into Execution.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> depends chiefly upon the Goodness and Quickness of
Feeling in the Hand, a Delicacy which Nature alone can give, and which
she does not always bestow. The first Sensation of the Hand consists
in a greater or less Degree of Fineness in the Touch or Feeling; all
of us are equally furnished with Nerves, from which we have the Sense
of Feeling, but as this Sense is much more subtle and quick in some
Persons than in others, it is impossible to give a precise Definition
of the exact Degree of Feeling in the Hand, which ought to communicate
and answer to the same Degree of Feeling in the Horse's Mouth; because
there is as much difference in the Degrees of Feeling in Men, as there
is in the Mouths of Horses.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">I suppose</span> then a Man, who is not only capable to judge of the
Qualities of a Horse's Mouth from a Knowledge of the Theory, but who
has likewise by Nature that Fineness of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span> Touch, which helps to form
a good Hand; let us see then what the Rules are that we must follow,
in order to make it perfect, and by which we must direct all its
Operations.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A horse</span> can move four different Ways, he can advance, go
back, turn to the Right, and to the Left; but he can never make these
different Motions, unless the Hand of the Rider permits him by making
four other Motions which answer to them: So that there are five
different Positions for the Hand.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> first is that general Position, from which proceed, and
indeed ought to proceed, the other four.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hold</span> your Hand three Fingers breadth from your Body, as high
as your Elbow, in such a Manner that the Joint of your Little-finger
be upon a right Line with the Tip of the Elbow; let your Wrist be
sufficiently rounded, so that your Knuckles may be kept directly above
the Neck of your Horse; let your Nails be exactly opposite your Body,
the Little-finger nearer to it than the others, your Thumb quite flat
upon the Reins, which you must separate, by putting your Little-finger
between them, the right Rein lying upon it; this is the first and
general Position.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Does</span> your Horse go forward, or rather would you have him go
forward? Yield to him your Hand, and for that Purpose turn your Nails
downwards, in such a Manner as to bring your Thumb near your Body,
remove your Little-finger from it, and bring it into the Place where
your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span> Knuckles were in the first Position, keeping your Nails directly
above your Horse's Neck; this is the second.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Would</span> you make your Horse go backwards? quit the first
Position, let your Wrist be quite round, let your Thumb be in the Place
of the Little-finger in the second Position, and the Little-finger in
that of the Thumb, turn your Nails quite upwards, and towards your
Face, and your Knuckles will be towards your Horse's Neck; this is the
third.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Would</span> you turn your Horse to the Right, leave the first
Position, carry your Nails to the Right, turning your Hand upside down,
in such a manner, that your Thumb be carried out to the Left, and the
Little-finger brought in to the Right; this is the fourth Position.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lastly</span>, Would you turn to the Left, quit again the first
Position, carry the Back of your Hand a little to the Left, so that the
Knuckles come under a little, but that your Thumb incline to the Right,
and the Little-finger to the Left; this makes the fifth.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">These</span> different Positions however alone are not sufficient;
we must be able to pass from one to another with Readiness and
Order.&mdash;&mdash;Three Qualities are especially necessary to the Hand. It
ought to be <i>firm</i>, <i>gentle</i>, and <i>light</i>; I call that a <i>firm</i> or
<i>steady Hand</i>, whose Feeling corresponds exactly with the Feeling
in the Horse's Mouth, and which consists in a certain Degree of
Steadiness, which constitutes the just Correspondence between the Hand
and the Horse's Mouth, which every Horseman wishes to find.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
<span class="smcap">An</span> <i>easy</i> and <i>gentle Hand</i> is that which by relaxing a little
of its Strength and Firmness, eases and mitigates the Degree of Feeling
between the Hand and Horse's Mouth, which I have already described.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lastly</span>, a <i>light</i> Hand is that which lessens still more the
Feeling between the Rider's Hand and the Horse's Mouth, which was
before moderated by the <i>gentle</i> Hand.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Hand therefore, with respect to these Properties, must
operate in part, and within certain Degrees; and depends upon being
more or less felt, or yielded to the Horse, or with-held.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> should be a Rule with every Horseman, not to pass at once
from one Extreme to another, from a firm Hand to a slack one; so that
in the Motions of the Hand, you must upon no account jump over that
Degree of Sensation which constitutes the <i>easy</i> or <i>gentle</i> Hand.
Were you at once to go from a firm Hand or a slack one, you would then
entirely abandon your Horse; you would surprize him, deprive him of the
Support he trusted to, and precipitate him on his Shoulders, supposing
you do this at an improper time; on the contrary, were you to pass from
a slack to a tight Rein all at once, you must jerk your Hand, and give
a violent Shock to the Horse's Mouth, which rough and irregular Motion
would be sufficient to falsify the finest Apuy, and ruin a good Mouth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
<span class="smcap">It</span> is indispensibly necessary therefore, that all its
Operations should be gentle and light; and in order to this, it is
necessary that the Wrist alone should direct and govern all its
Motions, by turning and steering it, if I may so say, through every
Motion that it is to make.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> consequence then of these Principles, I insist that the
Wrist be kept so round, that your Knuckles may be always directly above
the Horse's Neck, and that your Thumb be always kept flat upon the
Reins. In reality, were your Wrist to be more or less rounded, than in
the Degree I have fixed, you could never work with your Hand, but by
the means of your Arm; and besides, it would appear as if it were lame:
Again, were your Thumb not to be upon the Flat of the Reins, they would
continually slip through the Hand, and, by being lengthen'd, would
spoil the Apuy; and in order to recover them, you would be obliged
every Moment to raise your Hand and Arm, which would throw you into
Confusion, and make you lose that Justness and Order, without which no
Horse will be obedient, and work with Readiness and Pleasure.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is nevertheless true, that with Horses that are well drest,
one may take Liberties; these are nothing else but those Motions which
are called <i>Descents</i> of the Hand, and they are to be made three
different ways; either by dropping the Knuckles directly and at once
upon the Horse's Neck, or by taking the Reins in the Right-hand, about
four Fingers breadth above the Left, and letting them slide through the
Left, dropping your Right-hand at the same time upon the Horse's Neck;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
or else by putting the Horse under the <i>Button</i>, as it is call'd; that
is, by taking the End of the Reins in your Right-hand, quitting them
entirely with your Left, and letting the End of them fall upon your
Horse's Neck: these Motions however, which give a prodigious Grace to
the Horseman, never should be made but with great Caution, and exactly
in the time when the Horse is quite <i>together</i>, and in the Hand; and
you must take care to counter-balance, by throwing back your Body, the
Weight of the Horse upon his Haunches.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Apuy being always in the same Degree, would heat the
Mouth, would dull the Sense of Feeling, would deaden the Horse's Bars,
and render them insensible and callous; this shews the Necessity of
continually yielding and drawing back the Hand to keep the Horse's
Mouth fresh and awake.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Besides</span> these Rules and Principles, there are others not less
just and certain, but whose Niceness and Refinement it is not the Lot
of every Man to be able to taste and understand. My Hand being in the
first Position, I open the two Middle-fingers, I consequently ease and
slacken my Right Rein; I shut my Hand, the Right Rein operates again,
and resumes the Apuy. I open my Little-finger, and putting the End
of it upon the Right Rein, I thereby slacken the Left, and shorten
the Right. I shut my Hand entirely, and open it immediately again; I
thereby lessen the Degree of Tension and Force of the two Reins at the
same time; again I close my Hand not quite so much, but still<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span> I close
it. It is by these Methods, and by the Vibration of the Reins, that I
unite the Feeling in my Hand with that in the Horse's Mouth; and it is
thus that I play with a fine and <i>made</i> Mouth, and freshen and relieve
the Bars in which the Feeling or Apuy resides.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is the same with respect to the second <i>Descent</i> of the
Hand: My Right-hand holding the Reins, I pass and slide my Left-hand
upon the Reins up and down, and in the Degree of Apuy of the <i>easy</i> and
<i>slack</i> Hand; by the means of which the Horse endeavours of himself
to preserve the Correspondence and Harmony of that mutual Sensation,
between his Mouth and the Rider's Hand, which alone can make him submit
with Pleasure to the Constraint of the Bit.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">I have</span> thus explained the different Positions and Motions of
the Hand; let me shew now in a few Words the Effects which they produce.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Horseman's Hand directs the Reins; the Reins operate upon
the Branches of the Bit; the Branches upon the Mouth-piece and the
Curb; the Mouth-piece operates upon the Bars, and the Curb upon the
Beard of the Horse.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Right Rein guides the Horse to the Left; the Left Rein
to the Right. Would you go to the Right, you pass to the fourth
Position of the Hand, that is, you carry and turn your Nails to the
Right; now in carrying thus your Nails to the Right, and reversing
your Hand in such a manner, that your Thumb point to the Left, and
your Little-finger being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span> raised turns to the Right, you by this means
shorten your Left Rein; it is this Left therefore that turns and guides
the Horse to the Right: Would you go to the Left, pass to the fifth
Position, you will carry the Back of your Hand to the Left, so that
your Nails will be turned down a little, your Thumb will be to the
Right, and the Little-finger to the Left; this will shorten the right
Rein, and the right Rein determines your Horse to the Left.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">I have</span> already said, that the Effect which the Mouth-piece has
upon the Bars, and the Curb upon the Beard, depends upon the Branches
of the Bitt; when the Branches rise or are turned upwards, the
Mouth-piece sinks, and when the Branches sink, the Mouth-piece rises;
so that when your Horse is going strait forward, if you keep your Hand
low and close to your Body, the Mouth-piece then presses strong upon
the Bars, and the Chain or Curb having, in consequence more Liberty,
acts less upon the Beard; on the contrary, if you keep your Hand high,
a little forward, and consequently a little out of the Line of the
End of the Branches, the Mouth-piece then sinks, and the Branches of
necessity operate upon the Curb, which presses then very strongly upon
the Beard; now, in order to place, and to bring in your Horse's Head,
you must hold your Hand low, and in order to raise and lighten a Horse
that weighs upon the Hand, and carries his Head too low, you must
advance your Hand a little, and keep it high.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Would</span> you have your Horse go backward? Come to the third
Position, but take care to round your Wrist exactly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span> in order to work
equally with both Reins, and by this means to aid your Horse more
effectually to go backward strait and ballanced between your Legs,
which he could never do, if one Rein was to operate stronger than the
other.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">There</span> are particular Cases, where the Reins are separated,
and one held in each Hand; it is usual to separate them when you trot
a young Horse, or when you are to work one who is disobedient, and
resists his Rider; upon these occasions, keep both your Hands upon a
Level, low and near your Body: To turn to the right, use your right
Rein; to go to the left, use your left Rein; but in order to make them
have their Effect, move your Arm gently, turning it a little from your
Body, keeping your Hand always low and even near your Boot.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Such</span> are the Principles upon which the Perfection and Justness
of the Aids of the Hand depend, all others are false, and not to be
regarded; Experience has so much the more evinced the Truth of this, as
the new Discoveries which some People imagine they have lately made,
have produced nothing but Hands, cold and unactive, without Firmness,
whose irregular and capricious Motions serve only to render a Horse's
Mouth uncertain and fickle, and who, by their manner of holding them
high, have ruined absolutely the Hocks of all the Horses, that they
have worked according to these absurd Notions.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAP_III" id="CHAP_III"></a>CHAP. III.<br />
<i>Of Disobedience in Horses, and the Means to correct it.</i></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span><span class="smcap">Disobedience</span> in Horses is more frequently owing to the want of
Skill in the Horseman, than proceeding from any natural Imperfections
in the Horse; in effect, three things may give rise to it, Ignorance, a
bad Temper, and an Incapacity in the Animal to do what is required of
him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">If</span> a Horse is ignorant of what you expect him to do, and you
press him, he will rebel, nothing is more common; teach him then, and
he will know; a frequent Repetition of the Lessons will convert this
Knowledge into a Habit, and you will reduce him to the most exact
Obedience.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">He</span> refuses perhaps to obey, this Fault may arise either from
Ill-humour, Dullness, or from too much Mettle; it often is the Effect
of the two first Vices, sometimes the Result of all the three. In
either, or all these Instances, recourse must be had to Rigour, but it
must be used with Caution; for we must not forget, that the Hopes of
Recompence have as great an Influence over the Understanding of the
Animal, as the Fear of Punishment. Perhaps he is not able to execute
what you ask of him; examine him, something may be amiss in some Part
of his Body, or perhaps in the whole Body; he may be deficient, he may
want Strength, or not be light enough; perhaps he is deficient<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span> in
both, in that he resists and rebels. Consider whether he knows what he
should do or not; if he is ignorant, teach him; if he knows, but can't
execute through Inability, endeavour to assist Nature as far as you
can, by the Help of Art. But does he already know, and is he able too,
and yet does he refuse to obey? After having first tried every Method
that Patience and Lenity can suggest, compel him by Force and Severity.
It behoves then every Horseman, who would be perfect in his Art, to
distinguish from whence the different Sorts of Defences and Rebellion
in Horses proceed: And this Knowledge is by so much the more difficult
to attain, as he must have Penetration enough to distinguish if the
Cause of their Rebellion is in their Character and Nature, or owing to
any Fault in their Make and Structure.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> different Natures of Horses are infinite, though there are
certain general Principles, of which all, more or less, always partake.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A Horse</span> may be imperfect from four Causes, Weakness, Heaviness
in his Make, Want of Courage, and Sloth.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Four</span> Qualities must conspire to make a perfect Horse,
Strength, Activity, Courage, and Judgment.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Mixture of these different Qualities occasions the
different Natures and Dispositions of the Creature, according as he
is form'd better or worse; for it is from his Temper, or rather from
the Harmony or Unfitness of the Parts and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span> Elements, of which he is
composed, that we are enabled to fix his Character; it is therefore the
Part of every Horseman never to work but with Discretion and Caution,
and to adapt his Rules and Lessons to the Nature and Ability of the
Horse he undertakes, and which he ought to know.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A Horse</span> may be difficult to be mounted, examine the Source of
this Vice; it may be owing either to the Ignorance or the Brutality of
those who have first had to do with him, or perhaps that the Saddle may
have hurt him, or else to a Temper naturally bad. To whatever Cause it
may be owing, remember never to beat him, for instead of curing him,
you would certainly confirm him in his Vice; clap him gently when you
approach him, stroke his Head and Mane, talk to him, and as you talk,
clap the Seat of the Saddle; keep yourself still all the while, put
your Foot only in the Stirrup to encourage your Horse, without doing
any more, in order to make him familiar, and lose all Apprehension
and Fear when he is going to be mounted; by degrees at last he will
let you mount him, you will immediately get down and remount, and so
successively for several Times together, without attempting to do any
thing else, but send him back to the Stable. If it happens that then
when you are upon him, he runs from the Place where you got upon him,
bring him to it immediately, keep him there some Time, coax him, and
send him away.&mdash;&mdash;The first Lessons ought to be well weigh'd; when you
undertake to bring a young Horse to Obedience, and to reclaim him from
Liberty to the Subjection of the Bridle, Saddle, and the Weight of his
Rider,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span> so restrain'd, it is not surprizing if he should employ all his
Strength against you in his own Defence.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Generality of Colts are difficult to be turn'd and guided
as you would have them go; we ought not however to be surprized at this
their first Disobedience, it must be imputed to the Habit they acquire
from their Birth, of constantly following their Dams. Indulged in this
Liberty, and subjected all at once by the Bit, it is but natural they
should rebel; there is no way of eradicating these first Impressions,
but by Gentleness and Patience: A Horseman, who should make use of
Force and Correction, and employ it all at once upon a young Horse,
would discourage and make him vicious ever after. If therefore your
Horse refuses to go forward, you must lead another Horse before
him, the Person who rides the Colt will try from Time to Time, and
insensibly, to make the Colt go a-breast with him, and afterwards get
before him; if being surprized at seeing the Horse no longer, he stops
or runs back, the Rider must endeavour to drive him forward, either
by his Voice, or some Kind of slight Punishment, or he that rides the
other Horse may give him a Stroke with the Chambriere, in order to make
him go forward; if these Methods should not succeed, he will go before
him again with the other Horse, by degrees (for one Lesson wont be
sufficient) the Colt will grow accustom'd to it, and at last will go on
of himself.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Most</span> Horses who start, have some Defect in their Sight, which
makes them fear to approach the Object. The Horseman, upon those
Occasions, instead of having Recourse to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span> Punishment, which serves
only to alarm the Horse, and extinguish his Courage and Vigour, should
first endeavour to lead him gently towards the Object that terrifies
him, either by encouraging him with his Voice, or by closing his Legs
upon him, to make him go up to it. If he wont go towards it, you may
give him the Spurs, but with Discretion, and by Coaxing and Caresses
push him towards it insensibly; severe Correction will never cure him
of this fearful Temper, which is a Fault inherent in his Nature, nor
of any Imperfections in his Sight, which is a Disorder belonging to
him, but the Habit of viewing the Objects which alarm him, may in time
remedy the Defects of Nature.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">If</span> notwithstanding you perceive that Sloth and Malice are
added to these Faults, you must use as you find necessary both Mildness
and severe Correction, and you will bestow them in proportion to the
Effect they produce. For the rest, be careful never to surprize a young
Horse who is shy, and apt to start, never terrify him with what he
most fears, never beat him to make him come up to an Object which he
dreads; accustom him by degrees to it, and have Patience; the Fear of
Punishment does oftentimes more harm, and is more dreaded by him, than
the very Object which first alarmed him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">There</span> are some Horses, who are struck with such Terror at the
Sight of a Stone or Wooden Bridge, and at the Sound and Echo of the
hollow Part of it, that they will fling themselves headlong into the
Water, without the Riders being able to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span> restrain them: They are to be
cur'd of this Apprehension by covering the Pavement of their Stall with
Wooden Planks, between two or three Feet high; and the Horse standing
constantly upon them, his Feet will make the same Noise as they do
when he goes over a Bridge, and he will of course grow familiar to the
Sound, and lose all Apprehension of it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">To</span> accustom them likewise to the Noise of the Water running
under the Bridge, lead him to a Mill, fix two Pillars directly over
against the Wheels, and tie your Horse constantly for two Hours
together, several Times in the Day; having done this, bring him back to
the Bridge, let an old Horse, that is not afraid, go before him upon
the Bridge, by degrees you will find him go over the Bridge as readily
and quietly as if he had never had the least Apprehension.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">For</span> Horses that are addicted to lay down in the Water, you
must provide yourself with two little Leaden Balls, tie them to a Piece
of Packthread, and in the Moment that he is lying down, you must drop
these into his Ears, and if he rises instantly, or forbears to lay
down, draw them back; but this Method is not less sure than that of
breaking a Flask fill'd with Water upon his Head, and letting the Water
run into his Ears.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fire</span>, Smoke, the Smell of Gunpowder, and the Noise of Guns,
or other Arms, naturally surprize and frighten a Horse.&mdash;There are few
that will come near Fire, or pass by it without Difficulty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
<span class="smcap">There</span> are many Occasions however, wherein it is necessary; it
is therefore proper to accustom your Horse to it. In the first place,
begin with your Horse by letting him see it; and for that purpose tie
him between two Pillars, and hold before him, at about thirty Paces
distant, a burning Wisp of Straw; this should be continued for some
Days together, repeating it several times each Day. Let the Person who
holds the Brand, advance towards the Horse step by step, and let him
take care to advance or stop often, as he perceives the Horse is more
or less frighten'd, who in a short time will be imbolden'd, and no
longer afraid of the Fire: After this get up on him, carry him slowly,
and, as it were, insensibly towards the Brand, the Person who holds it
taking care not to stir: If your Horse comes up to it, without being
frighten'd, let the Man on Foot walk on, and let the Horse follow the
Fire. Lay upon the Ground some Straw about half burnt out, and he will
pass over it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">With</span> respect to the Noise of Arms and Drums, let your Horse
hear them before you give him his Oats: Do this regularly every Day,
for some time, and he will be so used to them as not to mind them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A Horse</span> is said to be <i>entier</i> to that Hand, to which he
refuses to turn; a Hurt in his Foot, Leg, or Shoulder, may often be the
Cause of his refusing to turn to that Side, where he feels any Pain;
a Hurt in his Loins or Haunch, a Curb or Spavin, by hindering him to
bend and rest upon his Hocks, may make him guilty of this Disobedience.
Art can do little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span> towards curing these Evils, consequently a Horse so
affected will never dress well, because he never can be made supple and
ready; besides, every Horse is naturally inclin'd to go to one Hand
more than the other, and then he will go to that Hand on which he finds
himself the weakest, because with the strongest he can turn more easily.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">They</span> may likewise refuse to turn, from some Defect in their
Sight, natural or accidental. I have tried a Method to remedy this
Vice, which has answer'd very well; I have put a Lunette upon the
ailing Eye, and as his Fault was owing to his Eye, the Horse began by
degrees to go to that Hand to which before he had refused to turn:
After this I made two little Holes in the Lunette; I enlarged them
afterwards, and the Eye of the Horse being thus insensibly accustom'd
to receive the Light, and he to turn to that Hand, he no longer
disobeyed; I exercised him in this Manner from time to time, in order
to confirm him in his Obedience.&mdash;I have said, that there is no Horse
who is not by Nature inclin'd to go better to one Hand than the other;
their inclination generally carries them to the Left rather than to
the Right. Some People impute this Preference to the Manner in which
the Foal lies in its Dam's Belly, and pretend that even then it is
entirely bent and turn'd to the Left: Others insist that Horses lay
down generally upon their Right-side, and from thence contract a Habit
to turn their Heads and Necks to the Left: But not to regard these
groundless Notions, it is easier and more natural to believe, that this
Habit is owing to Use, and the Manner in which they are treated by
those who first have had the Care of them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
<span class="smcap">The</span> Halter, the Bridle, the Saddle, and the Girths are all
put on and tied on the Left-side; when they are rubb'd or curried, the
Man stands on the Left-side; the same when they are fed, and when they
are led out, the Man holds them in his Right-hand, consequently their
Head is pull'd to the Left. Here are a Chain of Reasons, sufficient
to induce us to believe that if they are readier to turn to one Hand
than the other, it is owing to a Habit and Custom which we ourselves
have given. We seldom meet with Horses that are readier to turn to the
Right-hand than the Left; and when it so happens, it oftentimes denotes
an ill Temper; it demands much Time and Pains to cure them of this
Fault.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is not proper to use severe Correction to make a Horse
obey, who refuses to turn to one Hand; if he is cold and dull, he will
lose all his Vigour and Courage; if he is of an angry Temper, hot and
brisk, you would make him desperate and mad; work him then upon the
Principles of Art, and pursue the Methods you think most likely to
reform his ill Habit, and reduce him to Obedience; if he obstinately
refuses to turn to one Hand, begin the next Lesson, by letting him
go to his favourite Hand a turn or two; finish him on the same Hand,
by degrees you'll gain him; whereas were you to do otherwise, you
might make him ever afterwards rebellious. A Horse that strenuously
resists his Rider, if he has Vigour and Courage, after he is reduced
and conquer'd, will nevertheless succeed in what you want of him,
provided he is under the Direction of an able and knowing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span> Person, who
understands the Aids of the Hand and Legs, and their mutual Harmony and
Correspondence.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Such</span> a Horse is even preferable to one who never rebels;
because in this last, Nature may be deficient, if I may so express
myself, from his Want of Strength and Resolution.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> order to teach your Horses to turn to both Hands, you must
separate your Reins, as I have already mention'd; don't confine him too
much, support him moderately so that you may easily draw his Head to
one side or the other, as you would have him go, and to give him the
greater Liberty to turn.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">If</span> he refuses to obey, examine him; if he is by Nature
impatient, hot and vicious, by no means beat him, provided he will
go forwards; because being held in Hand, and kept back a little, is
Punishment enough; if he stops, and strives to resist by running back,
drive him forward with the Chambriere.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Resistance of a Horse, whose Mouth is faulty, discovers
itself more in going forward than backward, and in forcing the Hand; a
Horse of this sort ought never to be beat; he ought to be kept back,
as I have just now said. You must endeavour to give him a good and
just Apuy, and put him upon his Haunches, in order to cure him of the
Trick of leaning upon his Bit, and forcing the Hand. If your Horse is
heavy, never press or put him together, till you have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span> lighten'd his
Fore-part, and put him upon his Haunches, for fear of throwing him so
much upon his Shoulders, that it may be very difficult afterwards to
raise him. Take particular care to lighten every Horse that is heavy
before, and has Malice in his Temper at the same time; for if you
were to press him, he would resist you through Vice; in which Case by
his Want of Strength on one hand, and being heavy and unwieldy on the
other, you would be exposed to evident Danger.</p>

<p>A <i>restive</i> Horse is one that refuses to go forward, who standing still
in the same Place, defends himself, and resists his Rider in several
different Manners; it is much to be fear'd that one should lose all
Temper with such a Horse, since it requires a great deal of Patience
to cure so Capital a Fault, and which perhaps by Habit and Time is so
rooted in him as to be almost natural to him; treat a Horse of this
sort, who has been too much constrain'd and tyrannized over, with the
same Lenity that you would shew to a young Colt.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Spurs are as improper to be used to one as the other;
make use of your Switch in order to drive him forward, you will alarm
him the less; the Spurs surprize a Horse, abate his Courage, and are
more likely to make him restive, than oblige him to go forward, if he
refuses to do so. There is likewise another Method to punish a restive
Horse; it is to make him go backwards the Moment he begins to resist;
this Correction often succeeds; but the general Rule is to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span> push and
carry your Horse forward, whenever he refuses to advance, but continues
in the same Place, and defends himself, either by turning or flinging
his Croupe on one side or the other; and for this Purpose nothing is so
efficacious as to push him forward vigorously.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> most dangerous of all Defences a Horse can make is to rise
directly upon his Hind-legs, and stand almost quite strait, because he
runs a risque of falling backwards; and in that Case the Rider would be
in Danger of his Life. People have endeavour'd to correct this Vice, by
a Method of Punishment, which might prove dangerous, unless given in
<i>time</i> and with the greatest Exactness.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> the Horse rises strait up, throw your Body forward, and
give him all the Bridle; the Weight of your Body on his Fore-parts will
oblige him to come down: In the Minute that his Fore-feet are coming
to the Ground, give him both the Spurs firm, and as quick as you can;
these Aids and Corrections however must be given with the greatest
Caution and Exactness: For were you to give him the Spurs when he is in
the Air, he would fall over; whereas if you watch the Time so as not to
spur him but when he is coming down, and his Fore-feet near the Ground,
it is then impossible he should fall backwards; for then his Balance is
destroy'd, and he is upon all his Legs again, and can't rise without
first touching the Ground, and taking his Spring thence; if therefore
you give him the Spurs before he is in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span> a Situation to rise again, you
will punish him, and drive him forward at the same time.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> Defence is still more dangerous in Horses who are of a
fiery Temper, and weak in their Haunches, at the same time; these are
continually apt to rise, and whatever Precautions the Rider may take,
he is in continual Danger of their coming over. The way to correct them
is this: Tie your Horse between the Pillars very short, put on a good
Cavason of Cord, and don't suffer him to be mounted; prick him upon the
Buttocks with a Hand-spur in order to make him strike out; encourage
him when he kicks, and continue to make him kick; encourage him from
time to time when he obeys; do this for a Quarter of an Hour every Day;
when you perceive that he begins to kick the Moment you offer to prick
him, without waiting till he feels it, get upon him, hold your Reins
long, prick him, and let a Man stand by and prick him at the same time.
Encourage him when he kicks, and continue to prick him to make him do
it, till he will kick readily only at the Offer you make of pricking
him; he ought to be brought to this Point in five or six Days: After
this take him out of the Pillars, mount him, and trot him in the Longe,
and make him kick by pricking him behind; after that let him walk two
or three Steps, then make him kick again, and so work him by degrees.
Put him to the Gallop; if he offers to rise, prick him behind, and make
him kick: Nothing excels this Method to break a Horse of this terrible
and dangerous Vice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
<span class="smcap">Those</span> Horses who are apt to kick, either when they go forward
or stand still, must be kept much together, or held in closely; make
them go backward briskly, and you will cure them of this Vice.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">To</span> resume our Subject. All Horses are by Nature rather
aukward than nervous and strong; fearful than bold; hot and fretful
than mischievous or ill-temper'd; whenever they grow desperate and
absolutely ungovernable, it is often rather to avoid the extreme Pain
which they feel, or expect to feel from too great a Constraint, than
merely to resist the Horseman. Arm yourself then with great Patience;
keep such Horses as are of a fiery and fretful Disposition, rather in
Awe than in absolute Subjection; they are naturally fearful, and apt
to be alarm'd; and violent Correction and Force would dishearten and
make them quite desperate. Such as are of a hot and impetuous Temper,
are generally timid and malicious. Endeavour therefore to prevent the
Disorders they would commit; for Lenity and good Usage would never
reduce them to Obedience, and Severity would make them lifeless and
jadish. In fine, let your Lessons be short, easy, and often repeated to
Horses of a cold and heavy Disposition, because they have no Memory,
and want both Resolution and Strength.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> a word, never depart from this great Maxim, "Always observe
a just Medium between too indulgent a Lenity and extreme Severity;"
work your Horse according to his Strength<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span> and Capacity, give your
Lessons in proportion to his Memory, and dispense your Punishment and
Rewards suitable to his Courage and Disposition.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAP_IV" id="CHAP_IV"></a>CHAP. IV.<br />
<i>Of the Trot.</i></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> a Horse trots, his Legs are in this Position, two in the
Air and two upon the Ground, at the same time cross-wise; that is to
say, the Near-foot before, and the Off-foot behind are off the Ground,
and the other two upon it; and so alternately of the other two. This
Action of his Legs is the same as when he walks, except that in the
Trot his Motions are more quick. All Writers, both ancient and modern,
have constantly asserted the Trot to be the Foundation of every Lesson
you can teach a Horse; there are none likewise who have not thought
proper to give general Rules upon this Subject, but none have been
exact enough to descend into a Detail of particular Rules, and to
distinguish such Cases as are different, and admit of Exceptions, tho'
such often are found from the different Make and Tempers of Horses, as
they happen to be more or less suited to what they are destin'd; so
that by following their general Maxims, many Horses have been spoil'd,
and made heavy and aukward, instead of becoming supple and active; and
as much Mischief has been occasion'd by adopting their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span> Principles,
although just, as if they had been suggested by Ignorance itself.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Three</span> Qualities are essentially necessary to make the Trot
useful, it ought to be <i>extended</i>, <i>supple</i>, and <i>even</i> or <i>equal</i>;
these three Qualities are related to, and mutually depend upon each
other: In effect, you can't pass to the supple Trot, without having
first work'd your Horse upon the <i>extended</i> Trot; and you can never
arrive at the even and equal Trot, without having practised the Supple.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">I mean</span> by the <i>extended</i> Trot, that in which the Horse trots
out without retaining himself, being quite strait, and going directly
forwards; this consequently is the kind of Trot, with which you must
begin; for before any thing else ought to be meditated, the Horse
should be taught to embrace and cover his Ground readily, and without
fear.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Trot however may be <i>extended</i> without being supple, for
the Horse may go directly forward, and yet not have that Ease and
Suppleness of Limbs, which distinguishes and characterizes the <i>Supple</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">I define</span> the <i>supple</i> Trot to be that in which the Horse at
every Motion that he makes bends and plays all his Joints; that is to
say, those of his Shoulders, his Knees and Feet, which no Colts or raw
Horses can execute, who have not had their Limbs suppled by Exercise,
and who always trot with a surprizing Stiffness and Aukwardness, and
without the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span> least Spring or Play in their Joints. The <i>even</i> or
<i>equal</i> Trot, is that wherein the Horse makes all his Limbs and Joints
move so equally and exactly, that his Legs never cover more Ground one
than the other, nor at one Time more than another: To do this, the
Horse must of necessity unite and collect all his Strength, and if I
may be allowed the Expression, distribute it equally through all his
Joints.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">To</span> go from the <i>extended</i> Trot, to the <i>supple</i>, you must
gently, and by degrees, hold in your Horse; and when by Exercise he has
attain'd sufficient Ease and Suppleness to manage his Limbs readily,
you must insensibly hold him in, still more and more, and by degrees
you will lead him to the <i>equal</i> Trot.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Trot is the first Exercise to which a Horse is put; this
is a necessary Lesson, but if given unskilfully it loses its End, and
even does harm.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horses</span> of a hot and fretful Temper have generally too great a
Disposition to the <i>extended</i> Trot; never abandon these Horses to their
Will, hold them in, pacify them, moderate their Motion by retaining
them judiciously, and their Limbs will grow supple; they will acquire
at the same time that Union and Equality, which is so essentially
necessary.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">If</span> you have a Horse that is heavy, consider if this Heaviness
or Stiffness of his Shoulders or Legs is owing to a Want<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span> of Strength,
or of Suppleness; whether it proceeds from his having been exercised
unskilfully, too much, or too little. If he is heavy, because the
Motions of his Legs and Shoulders are naturally cold and sluggish, tho'
at the same time his Limbs are good, and his Strength is only confin'd
and shut up, if I may so say, a moderate but continual Exercise of
the Trot will open and supple his Joints, and render the Action of
his Shoulders and Legs more free and bold; hold him in the Hand, and
support him in the Trot, but take care so to do it, as not to check or
slacken his Pace: Aid him and drive him forward, while you support him;
remember at the same time, that if he is loaded with a great Head, the
Continuation of the Trot, will make his Apuy hard and dull, because
he will by this means abandon himself still more, and weigh upon the
Hand. All Horses that are inclined to be <i>remingue</i>, should be kept to
the extended Trot; every Horse who has a Tendency to be <i>remingue</i> is
naturally disposed to collect all his Strength, and to unite himself;
your only way with such Horses is to force them forward: In the Instant
that he obeys, and goes freely on, retain him a little; yield your Hand
immediately after, and you will find soon that the Horse of himself
will bend his Joints, and go united and equally.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A Horse</span> of a sluggish and cold Disposition, which has
nevertheless Strength and Bottom, should likewise be put to the
extended Trot; as he grows animated, and begins to go free, keep him
together by little and little, in order to lead him insensibly to the
<i>supple</i> Trot; but if while you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span> keep him together, you perceive that
he slackens his Action, and retains himself, give him the Aids briskly,
and push him forward, keeping him nevertheless gently in Hand; by this
means he will be taught to go freely and equally at the same time.</p>

<p>If a Horse of a cold and sluggish Temper is weak in his Legs and Loins,
you must manage him cautiously in working him in the Trot, or otherwise
you will enervate and spoil him. Besides, in order to make the most
of a Horse, who is not over strong, endeavour to give him Wind, by
working him slowly, and at Intervals, and by increasing the Vigour of
his Exercise by degrees; for you must remember that you ought always
to dismiss your Horse, before he is spent and overcome with Fatigue.
Never push your Lesson too far in hopes of suppling your Horse's Limbs
by means of the Trot; instead of this you will falsify and harden his
Apuy, which is a Case which happens but too frequently.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Farther</span>, it is of Importance to remark, that you ought at no
time, neither in the <i>extended</i>, <i>supple</i> or <i>equal</i> Trot, to confine
your Horse in the Hand in Expectation of raising him, and fixing his
Head in a proper Place; if his Apuy be full in the Hand, and the
Action of his Trot should be check'd and restrain'd by the Power of
his Bridle, his Bars would very soon grow callous, and his Mouth be
harden'd and dead; if, on the contrary, he has a fine and sensible
Mouth, this very Restraint would offend and make him uneasy. You must
endeavour then, as has already been said,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span> to give him by degrees,
and insensibly, a true and just Apuy, to place his Head, and form his
Mouth, by Stops and Half-stops; by sometimes moderating and restraining
him with a gentle and light Hand, and yielding it to him immediately
again; and by sometimes letting him trot without feeling the Bridle at
all.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">There</span> is a Difference between Horses who are <i>heavy</i> in the
Hand, and such as endeavour to <i>force</i> it. The first Sort lean and
throw all their Weight upon the Hand, either as they happen to be weak,
or too heavy and clumsy in their Fore-parts, or from having their
Mouths too fleshy and gross, and consequently dull and insensible. The
second <i>pull</i> against the Hand, because their Bars are lean, hard, and
generally round; and the first may be brought to go equal, and upon
their Haunches, by means of the Trot and slow Gallop; and the other may
be made light and active by Art, and by settling them well in their
Trot, which will also give them Strength and Vigour. Horses of the
first sort are generally sluggish, the other kind are for the most part
impatient and disobedient, and upon that very account more dangerous
and incorrigible.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> only Proof, or rather the most certain Sign of your
Horse's trotting well, is, that when he is in his Trot, and you begin
to press him a little, he offers to Gallop.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">After</span> having trotted your Horse sufficiently upon a strait
Line, or directly forward, work him upon large Circles; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span> before
you put him to this, walk him gently round the Circle, that he may
comprehend and know the Ground he is to go over.&mdash;This being done, work
him in the Trot; a Horse that is loaded before, and heavily made, will
find more Pains and Difficulty in uniting his Strength, in order to
be able to turn, than in going strait forward.&mdash;The Action of turning
trys the Strength of his Reins, and employs his Memory and Attention,
therefore let one Part of your Lessons be to trot them strait forward;
finish them in the same Manner, observing that the Intervals between
the Stops (which you should make very often) be long, or short, as you
judge necessary: I say you should make frequent Stops, for they often
serve as a Correction to Horses that abandon themselves, force the
Hand, or bear too much upon it in their Trot.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">There</span> are some Horses who are supple in their Shoulders, but
which nevertheless abandon themselves; this Fault is occasion'd by
the Rider's having often held his Bridle-hand too tight and strict
in working them upon large Circles: To remedy this, trot them upon
one <i>Line</i> or <i>Tread</i>, and very large; stop them often, keeping back
your Body and outward Leg, in order to make them bend and play their
Haunches.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> principal Effects then of the Trot, are to make a Horse
light and active, and to give him a just Apuy. In reality, in this
Action he is always supported on one Side by one of his Fore-legs,
and on the other by one of his Hind-legs: Now the fore and hind Parts
being equally supported<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span> cross-wise, the Rider can't fail to supple
and loosen his Limbs, and fix his Head; but if the Trot disposes and
prepares the Spirits and Motions of a sinewy and active Horse for the
justest Lessons, if it calls out and unfolds the Powers and Strength
of the Animal, which before were buried and shut up, if I may use the
Expression, in the Stiffness of his Joints and Limbs; if this first
Exercise to which you put your Horse, is the Foundation of all the
different Airs and Manages, it ought to be given in Proportion to the
Strength and Vigour of the Horse.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">To</span> judge of this you must go farther than mere outward
Appearances. A Horse may be but weak in the Loins, and yet execute any
Air, and accompany it with Vigour, as long as his Strength is united
and intire; but if he becomes disunited, by having been work'd beyond
his Ability in the Trot, he will then falter in his Air, and perform it
without Vigour and Grace.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">There</span> are also some Horses, who are very strong in the Loins,
but who are weak in their Limbs; these are apt to retain themselves,
they bend and sink in their Trot, and go as if they were afraid of
hurting their Shoulders, their Legs or Feet. This Irresolution proceeds
only from a natural Sense they have of their Weakness.&mdash;This kind of
Horses should not be too much exercised in the Trot, nor have sharp
Correction; their Shoulders, Legs, or Hocks would be weaken'd and
injur'd; so that learning in a little Time to hang back, and abandon
themselves on the Apuy, they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span> would never be able to furnish any Air
with Vigour and Justness.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Let</span> every Lesson then be weigh'd; the only Method by which
Success can be insured, is the Discretion you shall use, in giving them
in proportion to the Strength of the Horse, and from your Sagacity
in deciding upon what Air or Manage is most proper for him; to which
you must be directed by observing which seems most suited to his
Inclination and Capacity.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">I finish</span> this Chapter by describing the Manner of trotting a
Colt, who has never been back'd. Put a plain Snaffle in his Mouth, fit
a Caveson to his Nose, to the Ring of which you will tie a Longe of a
reasonable Length; let a Groom hold this Longe, who having got at some
Distance from the Colt, must stand still in the Middle of the Circle,
which the Horse will make; let another follow him with a long Whip or
Chambriere in his Hand.&mdash;The Colt being alarm'd, will be forced to go
forward, and to turn within the Length of the Cord.&mdash;The Groom must
hold it tight in his Hand, by this means he will draw <i>in</i> or towards
the Center the Head of the Colt, and his Croupe will consequently be
<i>out</i> of the Circle.&mdash;In working a young Horse after this Manner, don't
press or hurry him, let him walk first, afterwards put him to the Trot;
if you neglect this Method his Legs will be embarras'd, he will lean
on one Side, and be more upon one Haunch than the other; the inner
Fore-foot will strike against the outward, and the Pain which this will
occasion,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span> will drive him to seek some Means of Defence, and make him
disobedient.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">If</span> he refuses to trot, the Person who holds the Chambriere
will animate him, by hitting him, or striking the Ground with it. If he
offers to gallop instead of trotting, the Groom must shake or jirk the
Cord that is tied to the Caveson, and he will fall into his Trot.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> this Lesson you may decide more readily upon the Nature,
the Strength, the Inclination, and Carriage of the Horse, than you can
of one that has already been rode, as it is more easy to consider and
examine all his Motions; whereas when he is under his Rider, being
naturally inclin'd to resist at first, to free himself from Restraint,
and to employ all his Strength and Cunning to defend himself against
his Rider, it is morally impossible to form a true Judgment of his
Disposition and Capacity.</p>

<i>Of the Stop.</i></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span><span class="smcap">The</span> most certain Method to unite and assemble together the
Strength of a Horse, in order to give him a good Mouth, to fix and
place his Head, as well as to regulate his Shoulders, to make him light
in the Hand, and capable of performing all Sorts of Airs, depends
entirely upon the Perfection and Exactness of the Stop.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> order to mark or form the Stop justly, you must quicken him
a little, and in the Instant that he begins to go faster than the usual
<i>Cadence</i> or <i>Time</i> of his Pace, approach the Calves of your Legs, and
immediately afterwards fling back your Shoulders; always holding your
Bridle more and more tight, till the Stop is made, aiding the Horse
with the Calves of your Legs, in order to make him bend and play his
Haunches.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">By</span> varying the Times of making your Stops, and the Places
where you make them, you will teach your Horse to obey exactly the Hand
and Heel; which is the End that every one should propose to attain in
every Kind of Exercise of the Manege.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">With</span> a raw and young Horse make but very few Stops, and when
you make them, do it by degrees, very gently, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span> not all at once,
because nothing so much strains and weakens the Hocks of a stiff and
aukward Horse, as a sudden and rude Stop.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is agreed by every Body, that nothing so much shews the
Vigour and Obedience of a Horse as his making a beautiful and firm
Stop, at the End of a swift and violent Career. There are however many
Horses that have a good deal of Vigour and Agility, who can't stop
without feeling Pain, while there are others who are not so strong and
active, who stop very easily; the Reason of this is plain.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the first place, the Facility of stopping depends upon the
natural Aptness and Consent of the Horse; in the next place, his Make,
and the Proportions which the different Parts of his Body have to each
other, must be consider'd: Therefore we must measure the Merit of a
Stop by the Strength and Temper of the Horse, by the Steadiness of his
Head and Neck, and the Condition of his Mouth and Haunches.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> will be in vain to look for the Justness and Perfection
of the Stop in a Horse that is any ways defective, the Bars being too
delicate, or too hard, a thick Tongue, the Channel of his Mouth narrow,
the Thropple confin'd, Neck short, Fore-hand heavy, or too low, weak
Loins, or too stiff, too much Heat, or too much Flegm in his Temper, or
Sluggishness; here are a Number of Faults not easily to be corrected.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
<span class="smcap">A Horse</span>, though he is strong in his Shoulders, in his Legs and
Loins, yet if he is low before, will have much Difficulty to collect
himself upon his Haunches, so as to make a good Stop; on the contrary,
if his Shoulders and Neck are high and raised, he will have the greater
Part of the Qualities requisite to it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A Horse</span> who is long in the Back generally stops very
aukwardly, and without keeping his Head steady; a Horse that is short
and truss'd, with a thick Neck, generally stops upon his Shoulders.
The first finds too much Difficulty to collect his Strength so
suddenly, in order to put himself upon his Haunches, and the other is
not able to call it out, and distribute it with Vigour through his
Limbs.&mdash;In effect, when a Horse gallops, the Strength of his Loins,
of his Haunches and Hocks, is all employed in pushing the whole
Machine forwards, and that of his Shoulders and Fore-legs, to support
the Action: Now the Force of his hinder Parts being thus violently
agitated, and approaching too near that which lies in the fore Parts, a
short-body'd Horse can't find all at once, that Counterpoise, that just
Equilibre which characterizes a beautiful Stop.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A Horse</span> which can't stop readily, misemploys very often his
Strength in running; examine him, and you will find that he abandons
himself entirely upon his Shoulders; consider likewise the Proportions
of his Neck and his Thropple, the Condition of his Feet, the Make of
his Loins and Hocks; in short, apply yourself to the Discovery of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
Temper, Character and Humour.&mdash;That Horse whose Neck is hollow, or
Ewe-neck'd, instead of ballancing himself upon his Haunches, will arm
himself against his Chest, and will thereby make his Stops harsh and
disagreeable: Weak Feet, or Hocks that give him Pain, will make him
hate the Stop.&mdash;He will either endeavour to avoid it, or will make it
with Fear, so that he will be totally abandon'd upon the Apuy. If he
carries his Nose high, and is hollow-back'd at the same time, it will
be impossible for him to unite and put himself together, so as to be
ready, and to present his Front, if I may be allow'd the Word, to the
Stop; because the Strength of the Nape of the Neck depends upon the
Chine; and his Powers being thus disunited and broken, he will make his
Stop upon his Shoulders.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">There</span> is another Sort of Horses, who in hopes of avoiding
the Constraint of stopping upon their Haunches, plant themselves upon
their two Hind-legs; yield the Hand to them, in the Instant, and press
them forward, you will insensibly correct them of their Defence, which
happens only in Cases, where you stop them upon declining or uneven
Ground.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">There</span> are many People, who imagining they can unite their
Horses by the means of making a great Number of precipitate Stops, take
little heed whether the Creature which they undertake is too weak, or
has Strength sufficient for his Task.&mdash;The Horse, who, though strong,
has suffer'd in his Chine, in making the first Stop, will meditate a
Defence in his second<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span> or third; this will be to prevent the Rider in
his Design: And being alarm'd at the slightest Motion of the Hand he
will stop all at once, leaning with all his Force upon his Shoulders,
and lifting up his Croupe; which is a capital Fault, and not easy to be
remedied.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thus</span> it may happen, that a Horse may make his Stops very
defectively, either from some natural or accidental Faults in the
different Parts of his Body; or it may be owing to the Unskilfulness
and Ignorance of the Rider, or the Effect of Faults and bad Lessons
all together. Principles that are true and just will assist and reform
Nature, but a bad School gives birth to Vice and Defences that are
often not to be conquer'd. It behoves us then to follow with Exactness
those Lessons which are capable of bringing a Horse to form a perfect
Stop; that is to say, to such a Point as to be able to make his Stop
short, firm, and in one <i>time</i>; and in which he collects and throws his
Strength equally upon his Haunches and Hocks, widening and anchoring,
if I may so say, his two Hind-feet exactly even on the Ground, in such
a Manner that one does not stand before the other, but both are in a
Line.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> would be a Proof of great Ignorance to undertake to reduce
a Horse to the Justness of the Stop, before he had been work'd and
push'd out in the Trot and Gallop to both Hands, or before he was so
ready as never to refuse to launch out immediately into a full Gallop;
for if he should happen to be <i>restiff</i>, should disobey the Spurs, or
refuse to turn to either Hand, the Means that then must be used to fix<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
his Head, would contribute towards confirming him in one or other of
these Vices.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">If</span> your Horse has not readily obey'd in making his Stops,
make him go backwards, it is a proper Punishment for the Fault. If in
stopping he tosses up his Nose, or forces the Hand, in this Case keep
your Bridle-hand low and firm, and your Reins quite equal; give him no
Liberty, press upon his Neck with your Right-hand, till he has brought
down his Nose, and then immediately give him all his Bridle; this is
the surest Method to bring him into the Hand.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">To</span> compel a Horse to stop upon his Haunches, nothing is so
efficacious as Ground that is a little sloping; this is of service to
exercise such Horses upon as are naturally too loose in their Paces,
who are heavy and apt to abandon themselves upon the Hand, by this
means they become light before; you must nevertheless examine if his
Feet, his Loins, his Shoulders and Legs are sufficiently able to
bear it, for otherwise your Horse would soon be spoil'd: The whole
therefore depends in this Case, as in all others, upon the Sagacity and
Experience of the Horseman.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> a Horseman puts his Horse to the Stop, in such a Place as
I have mentioned, he should put the Stress of his Aids rather in his
Thighs and Knees, than in his Stirrups; one of the most trying Lessons
a Horse can be put to, is to stop him, and make him go backwards up
Hill; therefore upon these Occasions you must ease the fore Part of the
Horse as much as you can, and throw your whole Weight upon the hinder.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
We have already said, that there are some Horses, which from Weakness
in their Make, can never be brought to form a just and beautiful
Stop. There are others likewise, who are apt to stop too suddenly and
short upon their Shoulders, tho' otherwise naturally too much raised
before, and too light. These employ all their Power in order to stop
all at once, in hopes either of putting an end to the Pain they feel,
from the Rudeness of the Stop; or else perhaps that some Defect of
Sight makes them apprehend they are near something that they fear, for
almost all Horses, blind of one Eye, or of both, stop with the greatest
Readiness: take care never to make this sort of Horses go backward; on
the contrary, stop them slowly and by degrees, in order to embolden
them, remembring never to force, or keep them in too great a degree of
Subjection.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">I have</span> thus shown, that a Stop that is made with Ease,
Steadiness, and according to the Rules, will contribute a great deal
towards putting a Horse upon his Haunches, and giving him that firm,
equal, and light Apuy, which we always desire to gain; because a just
Stop makes a Horse bend and sink his hinder Parts; I have made it
likewise appear, that a sudden and ill-executed Stop raises the fore
Parts too much, stiffens the Hocks, and rather takes a Horse off his
Haunches, than sets him upon them. Let us now proceed to the Lesson of
teaching a Horse to go backward.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAP_VI" id="CHAP_VI"></a>CHAP. VI.<br />
<i>Of teaching a Horse to go backward.</i></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span><span class="smcap">The</span> Action of a Horse, when he goes backward, is to have
always one of his hinder Legs under his Belly, to push his Croupe
backward, to bend his Haunches, and to rest and ballance himself, one
time on one Leg, one on the other; this Lesson is very efficacious
to lighten a Horse, to settle him in the Hand, to make him ready to
advance and go forward, and to prepare him to put himself together, and
sit down upon his Haunches.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> should not however be practised, till the Horse has been
well laid out and worked in the Trot, and his Limbs are become supple;
because, till he is arrived to this Point, you should not begin to
unite or put him together: Care must be taken, that this Action of
going backward be just, and that in performing it, the Horse keeps his
Head steady, fixt, and in a right Place; that his Body be trussed or
gathered up, as it were, under him; that his Feet be even; that he be
not upon his Shoulders, but on the contrary, on his Haunches; for if
he should be false as to any of these Particulars, this Lesson, very
far from putting him together, would have the contrary Effect, and
dis-unite him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> order that a Horse may be able to execute what is required
of him, he must first comprehend what it is that is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span> asked of him,
and for this Purpose the Horseman should make his Lessons short, and
demand but little at a Time; begin then to make him go backward, when
he is arrived far enough to understand what you expect him to do; but
at first be contented with a little, it is sufficient if he understands
what you want.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">There</span> are Horses, who can go backward, not only with great
Ease, but do it even with the Exactness of Horses that are perfectly
drest; if you examine these Horses, you will find that all the Parts
of their Body are exactly proportioned; they have Strength, and Nature
herself has taught them to unite themselves; but there are others, who
can't go backwards without great Difficulty; these are weak in the
Back, or otherwise imperfect in their Make; don't demand too much of
these, work them with caution, for Rigour with such Horses, is never
successful.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">There</span> are another sort of Horses, who never can be reconciled
to Subjection; whenever you try to make them go backward, they fix
their fore Feet fast upon the Ground, and <i>arm</i> themselves; in this
Case you must endeavour to win them, as it were insensibly, and by
degrees. For this Purpose, raise your hand a little, remove it from
your Body, at the same time shake your Reins, and you will find that
by degrees you will accustom your Horse to obey; but remember at the
same time, that you would have a less share of Reason, than the Animal
you undertake to dress, were you to expect to reduce him to Obedience
all at once; your Horse answering to the Reins which you shake, will
move<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span> perhaps only one of his fore Feet, leaving the other advanced;
this Posture without doubt is defective, because he is dis-united; but
as Perfection can't be gained at once, Patience and gentle Usage are
the only certain Methods of bringing your Horse to perform what you
want. There are others, who when they go backward, do it with Fury and
Impatience; these you should correct, briskly, and support lightly with
your Legs, while they go backward. There are another sort, who work
their lower Jaw about as if they wanted to catch hold of the Bit, who
bear upon the Hand, and endeavour to force it; to such Horses you must
keep your Hand extremely low, and your Reins exactly even, distribute
equally the Power of each, by rounding your Wrist, and keeping your
Nails exactly opposite your Body.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">After</span> having made your Horse go backward, let him advance
two or three Steps, if he obeys the Hand readily.&mdash;This will take off
any Dislike or Fear, he may entertain from the Constraint of going
backward; if he forces the Hand in going backward, these three Steps
forward will contribute to bring him into it again; and lastly, they
prevent any Vice, that this Lesson might otherwise produce.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">After</span> having advanced three Steps, let him stop, and turn him;
you will by these means support him, and take him off from any ill
Designs, which the Treatment you are obliged to observe towards him,
in order to make him stop and go backward with Precision and Order,
might otherwise give rise to.&mdash;After having turned him, make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span> him go
backward, you will prevent his having too great Desire of going too
soon from the Place where he stopp'd, as well as from that to which he
turned.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Moment the Stop is made, give him his Bridle; by stopping
you have augmented the Degree of the Apuy in the Horse's Mouth; you
must increase it still more, in order to make him go backwards; hence a
hard Hand and bad Mouth.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> Reasoning is plain, and these Principles are true;
notwithstanding which, there are few Horsemen who attend to it, either
because they never think and reflect, or else that the Force of bad
Habits overcomes them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> Lesson, if well weigh'd and given properly, is a
necessary and certain Method of teaching Horses to make a good Stop,
of rendering them light and obedient when they pull or are beyond the
Degree of what is call'd <i>full in the Hand</i>.&mdash;But if given improperly,
or if too often repeated, it then grows to be a Habit, and a Habit is
no Correction. Never practise it long with Horses who are hot, and
who have hard Mouths, their Impatience and Heat, join'd to Habit and
Custom, would prevent them from knowing the Cause, and feeling the
Effects. It is the same with those who have short Fore-hands; for as
they are generally thick-shoulder'd and heavy, the Difficulty they feel
to collect themselves upon their Haunches, naturally disposes them to
press the Branches of the Bit against their Chest, by which means this
Lesson becomes quite ineffectual.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAP_VII" id="CHAP_VII"></a>CHAP. VII.<br />
<i>Of the uniting or putting a Horse together.</i></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span><span class="smcap">The</span> End which the Horseman proposes to attain by his Art, is
to give to the Horses, which he undertakes, the <i>Union</i>, without which,
no Horse can be said to be perfectly drest; every one allows that
the whole of the Art depends upon this, yet few People reason or act
from Principles and Theory, but trust entirely to Practice; hence it
follows, that they must work upon Foundations false and uncertain, and
so thick is the Darkness in which they wander, that it is difficult to
find any one who is able to define this Term of <i>uniting</i> or <i>putting</i>
a Horse <i>together</i>, which is yet so constantly in the Mouth of every
Body; I will undertake, however, to give a clear and distinct Idea of
it; and for that Purpose shall treat it with Order and Method.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> uniting then or putting together, is the Action by which
a Horse draws together and assembles the Parts of his Body, and his
Strength, in distributing it equally upon his four Legs, and in
re-uniting or drawing them together, as we do ourselves, when we are
going to jump, or perform any other Action which demands Strength and
Agility. This Posture alone is sufficient to settle and place the Head
of the Animal, to lighten and render his Shoulders and Legs active,
which from the Structure of his Body, support and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span> govern the greater
Part of his Weight; being then by these means made steady, and his
Head well placed, you will perceive in every Motion that he makes, a
surprizing Correspondence of the Parts with the whole. I say, that from
the natural Structure of a Horse's Body, his Legs and Shoulders support
the greatest Part of his Weight, in reality his Croupe or Haunches
carry nothing but his Tail, while his fore Legs, being perpendicular,
are loaded with the Head, Neck, and Shoulders; so that, let the Animal
be ever so well made, ever so well proportioned, his fore Part, either
when he is in Motion, or in a State of Rest, is always employed, and
consequently in want of the Assistance of Art to ease it; and in this
consists the <i>Union</i> or putting together, which by putting the Horse
upon his Haunches, counterballances and relieves his fore Part.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> <i>Union</i> not only helps and relieves the Part of the Horse
that is the weakest, but it is so necessary to every Horse, that no
Horse that is dis-united can go freely, he can neither Leap nor Gallop
with Agility and Lightness, nor run without being in manifest Danger
of falling and pitching himself headlong, because his Motions have no
Harmony, no Agreement one with another. It is allowed, that Nature
has given to every Horse a certain Equilibre, by which he supports
and regulates himself in all his Motions; we knew that his Body is
supported by his four Legs, and that his four Legs have a Motion, which
his Body must of necessity follow; but yet this natural Equilibre is
not sufficient. All Men can walk, they are supported on two Legs,
notwithstanding this we make a great Difference between that Person<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span> to
whom proper Exercises have taught the free Use of his Limbs, and him
whose Carriage is unimproved by Art, and consequently heavy and aukward.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">'Tis</span> just the same with respect to a Horse; we must have
recourse to Art to unfold the natural Powers that lay hid and are shut
up in him, if we mean he should make a proper Use of the Limbs which
Nature has given him; the Use of which can be discover'd and made
familiar to him no other way than by working him upon true and just
Principles.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Trot is very efficacious to bring a Horse to this Union
so important, and so necessary; I speak of the Trot, in which he is
supported and kept together, and suppled at the same time; this compels
the Horse to put himself together: in effect, the Trot in which a Horse
is well supported partakes of a quick and violent Motion: It forces a
Horse to collect and unite all his Strength, because it is impossible
that a Horse that is kept together, should at the same time abandon and
fling himself forward. I explain myself thus.&mdash;In order to support your
Horse in his Trot, the Horseman should hold his Hand near his Body,
keeping his Horse together a little, and have his Legs near his Sides.
The Effect of the Hand is to confine and raise the fore Parts of the
Horse; the Effect of the Legs is to push and drive forward the hinder
Parts: Now if the fore Parts are kept back or confin'd, and the hinder
Parts are driven forward, the Horse in a quick Motion, such as the
Trot, must of necessity sit down upon his Haunches, and unite and put
himself together.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
<span class="smcap">For</span> the same Reason making your Horse launch out vigorously
in his Trot, and quickening his Cadence from time to time, putting him
to make Pesades, stopping him and making him go backward, will all
contribute towards his acquiring the Union.&mdash;I would define his going
off readily, or all at once, not to be a violent and precipitate Manner
of Running, but only to consist in the Horse's being a little animated,
and going somewhat faster than the ordinary Time of his Pace.&mdash;Your
Horse trots, press him a little; in the Instant that he redoubles and
quickens his Action, moderate and shorten, if I may so say, the Hurry
of his Pace; the more then that he presses to go forward, the more
will his being check'd and confin'd tend to unite his Limbs, and the
<i>Union</i> will owe its Birth to opposite Causes; that is to say, on one
hand to the Ardour of the Horse who presses to go forward, and to the
Diligence and Attention of the Horseman on the other, who, by holding
him in, slackens the Pace, and raises the Fore-parts of the Creature,
and at the same time distributes his Strength equally to all his Limbs.
The Action of a Horse, when going backward, is directly opposite to his
abandoning himself upon his Shoulders; by this you compel him to put
himself upon his Haunches: this Lesson is by so much therefore the more
effectual, as that the Cause of a Horse's being dis-united, is often
owing to the Pain he feels in bending his Haunches.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Pesades have no less Effect, especially upon Horses
that are clumsy and heavy shoulder'd; because they teach them to use
them, and to raise them; and when they raise them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span> up, it follows of
necessity that all their Weight must be thrown upon their Haunches.
A light and gentle Hand then, and the Aids of the Legs judiciously
managed, are capable to give a Horse the <i>Union</i>; but it is not so
clear at what time we ought to begin to put a Horse upon his Haunches.
Is it not necessary before we do this, that the Horse should have his
Shoulders entirely suppled? It is evident, that a Horse can never
support himself upon his Haunches, unless his Fore-part be lightened;
let us see then by what means we may hope to acquire this Suppleness,
the only Source of light and free Action. Nothing can supple more the
Shoulders than the Working a Horse upon large Circles.&mdash;Walk him first
round the Circle, in order to make him know his Ground; afterwards try
to draw his Head <i>in</i>, or towards the Center, by means of your inner
Rein and inner Leg. For instance,&mdash;I work my Horse upon a Circle, and
I go to the Right by pulling the right Rein; I bring in his outward
Shoulder by the means of the left Rein, and support him at the same
time with my inner Leg; thus the Horse has, if I may so say, his Head
<i>in</i>, or towards the Center, although the Croupe is at Liberty. The
right Leg crosses over the left Leg, and the right Shoulder is suppled,
while the left Leg supports the whole Weight of the Horse in the
Action: In working him to the left Hand, and following the same Method,
the left Shoulder supples, and the right is pressed and confined. This
Lesson, which tends not only to supple the Shoulders, but likewise to
give an Apuy, being well comprehended by the Horse, I lead him along
the Side of the Wall,&mdash;having placed his Head, I make use of the inner
Rein, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span> draws in his Head, and I bring in his outward Shoulder by
means of the other Rein: In this Posture, I support him with my inner
Leg, and he goes along the Wall, his Croupe being out and at liberty,
and his inner Leg passing over and crossing his outward Leg at every
Step he makes.&mdash;By this, I supple his Neck, I supple his Shoulders, I
work his Haunches, and I teach the Horse to know the Heels. I say, that
the Haunches are worked, though his Croupe is at liberty, because it is
from the Fore-parts only, that a Horse can be upon his Haunches.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> effect, after having placed his Head, draw it <i>in</i>, and
you will lengthen his Croupe, you raise him higher before than behind,
his Legs come under his Belly, and consequently he bends his Haunches.
It is the same as when he comes down Hill, his Croupe, being higher
than his Fore-parts, is pushed under him, and the Horse is upon
his Haunches; since it is evident that the Hinder support all the
Fore-parts, therefore in going along the Side of the Wall, by the means
of the inner Rein, I put together and unite my Horse.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Behold</span> then, in short, the most certain Methods of enabling
yourself to give to a Horse this <i>Union</i>, this Freedom and Ease, by
which learning how to ballance his Weight equally and with Art, and
distributing his Strength with Exactness to all his Limbs, he becomes
able to undertake and execute with Justness and Grace, whatever the
Horseman demands of him, conformable to his Strength and Disposition.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAP_VIII" id="CHAP_VIII"></a>CHAP. VIII.<br />
<i>Of the Pillars.</i></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span><span class="smcap">It</span> is the same with respect to the Pillars, as with all other
Lessons which you must teach a Horse, in order to make him perfect in
his Air. Excellent in itself, it becomes pernicious and destructive
under the Direction of the Ignorant, and is not only capable to
dishearten any Horse, but to strain and ruin him entirely.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Pillar partly owes its Origin to the famous
<i>Pignatelli</i>[1]. Mess. <i>de la Broue</i> and <i>Pluvinel</i>, who were his
Scholars, brought it first into <i>France</i>; the first indeed made little
use of it, and seem'd to be very well appriz'd of its Inconveniencies
and Dangers; as for the other, one may say, that he knew not a better
or shorter Method of dressing and adjusting a Horse. In effect,
according to his Notions, working a Horse round a single Pillar could
never fail of setting him upon his Haunches, making him advance,
suppling and teaching him to turn roundly and exactly; and by putting
him between two Pillars, provided he had Vigour, he was taught to obey
the Heels readily, to unite himself, and acquire in a shorter time a
good Apuy in making Curvets. If he wanted to settle his Horse's Head
in a short time, the Pillars were very efficacious. He tied the Horse
between them to the Cords of the Snaffle which he had in his Mouth,
instead of the Bridle. There he work'd his Horse without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span> a Saddle,
and maintain'd, that if the Horse tossed or shook his Head, bore too
much, or too little upon his Bridle, he punish'd himself in such a
manner, that (as he imagin'd) the Horse was compell'd to put himself
upon his Haunches, and to take a good Apuy; especially as the Fear of
the Chambriere or Whip, always ready behind him, kept him in awe. The
Horse was often taken out of the two Pillars, in order to be put to the
single Pillar, with a Cord tied to the Banquet of the Bit as a false
Rein; here he was work'd by being made to rise before, and driven round
the Pillar, with a design and in hopes of making him step out and
embrace, or cover well the Ground he went round, as well as to give him
Resolution in his Work, and to cure him of Dullness and Sloth, if he
had it in his Temper. We don't know whether Mr. <i>Pluvinel</i>
designed any real Advantages from this Method or no; but be that as it
will, it prevails no longer among us.&mdash;It must be owned, that the two
Pillars of his inventing are still preserved, and that no Manage is
without them; but at least we have suppress'd the single Pillar, which
serves only to fatigue and harrass a Horse: Learn never to put a Horse
between the two Pillars till he is well suppled, and you have given him
the first Principles of the <i>Union</i> between the Legs, which are the
natural Pillars that every Horseman should employ. We must take care to
work the Horse with great Prudence at first, and as gently as possible;
for a Horse being in this Lesson very much confined and forced, and not
able to escape, nor to go forward nor backward, he oftentimes grows
quite furious, and abandons himself to every Motion that Rage and
Resentment can suggest. Begin then this Lesson in the plainest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span> Manner,
contenting yourself with only making him go from side to side, by means
of the Switch, or from fear of the Chambriere. At the End of some Days,
the Horse, thus become obedient, and accustomed to the Subjection of
the Pillars; try to make him insensibly go into the Cords, which when
he will do readily, endeavour to get a Step or two exact and in <i>time</i>
of the <i>Passage</i> or <i>Piaffer</i>.</p>

<p>Footnote 1: He liv'd at <i>Naples</i>, and was the most eminent Horseman of
his Time.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">If</span> he offers to present himself to it, be it never so little,
make him leave off, encourage him, and send him to the Stable; augment
thus your Lessons by degrees, and examine and endeavour to discover to
what his Disposition turns, that you may cultivate and improve it. The
worst Effect of the Pillars is the Hazard you run of entirely ruining
the Hocks of your Horse, if you don't distinguish very exactly between
those Parts and the Haunches. Many People think that when the Horse
goes into the Cords, he is of consequence upon his Haunches; but they
don't remark, that often the Horse only bends his Hocks, and that his
Hocks pain him by so much the more, as his hinder Feet are not in their
due Equilibre.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Fore-legs of a Horse are made like those of a Man,
the Knees are before or <i>without</i>, the Hinder-legs are shaped like
our Arms, he bends his Hocks as we do our Elbows; therefore if he
rises before very high, he must stretch and stiffen his Hocks, and
consequently can never be seated upon his Haunches; to be upon them,
the Horse must bend and bring them under him, because the more his
Hinder-legs are brought under him, the more his Hinder-feet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span> are in
the necessary Point of Gravity, to support all the Weight of his Body,
which is in the Air, in a just Equilibre.&mdash;These Remarks are sufficient
to evince the Inconveniencies that may arise from the Pillars; never
quit sight of these Principles, you will find by adhering to them, the
Horse that is drest according to their Tenour, will be a Proof of the
real Advantages that you may draw from a Lesson, which never does harm,
but when occasioned by the Imprudence or Ignorance of those who give
it.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAP_IX" id="CHAP_IX"></a>CHAP. IX.<br />
<i>Of Aids and Corrections.</i></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span><span class="smcap">An</span> Aid may be termed whatever assists or directs a Horse, and
whatever enables him to execute what we put him to do.&mdash;Corrections are
whatever Methods we use to awe and punish him, whenever he disobeys:
Aids therefore are to prevent, and Corrections to punish, whatever
Fault he may commit.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Aids are various, and are to be given in different
Manners, upon different Occasions, they are only meant to accompany the
Ease and Smoothness of the Horse in his Air, and to form and maintain
the Justness of it; for this Reason they ought to be delicate, fine,
smooth, and steady, and proportioned to the Sensibility or Feeling of
the Horse; for if they are harsh and rude, very far from Aiding, they
would throw the Horse into Disorder, or else occasion his Manage to be
false, his Time broken, constrained, and disagreeable.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Corrections</span> are of two Sorts; you may punish your Horse with
the Spurs, the Switch, or Chambriere; you may punish him by keeping
him in a greater Degree of Subjection; but in all these Cases, a real
Horseman will endeavour rather to work upon the Understanding of the
Creature, than upon the different Parts of his Body. A<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span> Horse has
Imagination, Memory and Judgment; work upon these three Faculties, and
you will be most likely to succeed. In reality, the Corrections which
reduce a Horse to the greatest Obedience, and which dishearten him the
least, are such as are not severe, but such as consist in opposing his
Will and Humour, by restraining and putting him to do directly the
contrary.&mdash;If your Horse don't advance or go off readily, or if he is
sluggish, make him go sideways, sometimes to one hand, sometimes to
the other, and drive him forward; and so alternatively.&mdash;If he goes
forward too fast, being extremely quick of feeling, moderate your
Aids, and make him go backwards some Steps; if he presses forward
with Hurry and Violence, make him go backward a great deal.&mdash;If he
is disorderly and turbulent, walk him strait forward, with his Head
<i>in</i> and Croupe <i>out</i>; these sorts of Corrections have great Influence
upon most Horses. It is true, that there are some of so bad and
rebellious Dispositions, which availing themselves of their Memory
to falsify their Lessons, require sharp Correction, and upon whom
gentle Punishment would have no Effect; but in using Severity to such
Horses, great Prudence and Management are necessary. The Character of a
Horseman is to work with Design, and to execute with Method and Order;
he should have more Forbearance, more Experience, and more Sagacity
than most People are possessed of.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Spurs, when used by a knowing and able Horseman, are of
great Service; but when used improperly, nothing so soon makes a Horse
abject and jadish. Given properly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span> they awe and correct the Animal;
given unduly, they make him restive and vicious, and are even capable
of Discouraging a drest Horse, and giving him a Disgust to the Manage;
don't be too hasty therefore to correct your Horse with them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Be</span> patient; if your Horse deserves Punishment, punish him
smartly, but seldom; for besides your habituating him to Blows, till he
ceases to mind them, you will astonish and confound him, and be more
likely to make him rebel, than to bring him to the Point you aim at.
To give your Horse both Spurs properly, you must change the Posture
of your Legs, and bending your Knee, strike him with them at once as
quick and firmly as you can. A Stroke of the Spurs wrongly given is
no Punishment; it rather hardens the Horse against them, teaches him
to shake and frisk about his Tail, and often to return the Blow with
a Kick. Take care never to open your Thighs and Legs in order to give
both Spurs, for besides that the Blow would not be at all stronger
for being given in this Manner, you would by this means lose the Time
in which you ought to give it, and the Horse would rather be alarmed
at the Motion you make in order to give the Blow, than punished by it
when he felt in; and thence your Action becoming irregular, could never
produce a good Effect.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Chambriere is used as a Correction, it ought however to
be used with Discretion; we will suppose it to be in able Hands, and
forbear to say more about it. As for the Switch, it is so seldom made
use of to punish a Horse,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span> that I shall not speak of it, till I come to
treat of the Aids.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">By</span> what has been said of Corrections, it is apparent, that the
Horseman works not only upon the Horse's Understanding, but even upon
his Sense of Feeling.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A Horse</span> has three Senses upon which we may work, Hearing,
Feeling and Seeing. The Touch is that Sense, by which we are enabled
to make him very quick and delicate, and when he is once brought to
understand the Aids which operate upon this Sense, he will be able to
answer to all that you can put him to.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Though</span> the Senses of Hearing and Sight are good in themselves,
they are yet apt to give a Horse a Habit of Working by Rote and of
himself, which is bad and dangerous. The Aids which are employed upon
the Touch or Feeling, are those of the Legs, of the Hand, and of the
Switch. Those which influence the Sight, proceed from the Switch; those
which affect the Sight and Hearing both, are derived from the Switch
and the Horseman's Tongue.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Switch ought neither to be long nor short, from three to
four Feet or thereabouts is a sufficient Length; you can give your
Aids more gracefully with a short than a long one. In a Manage, it
is generally held on the contrary Hand to which the Horse is going;
or else it is held up high at every Change of Hand: By holding the
Switch, the Horseman learns to carry his Sword in his Hand with Ease<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
and Grace, and to manage his Horse without being encumber'd by it. To
aid with the Switch, you must hold it in your Hand, in such a manner
that the Point of it be turned towards the Horse's Croupe, this is the
most convenient and easy Manner; that of aiding with it, not over the
Shoulder, but over the Bending of your Arm, by removing your left Arm
from your Body, and keeping it a little bent, so as to make the End of
the Switch fall upon the Middle of the Horse's Back, is very difficult
to execute.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Shaking</span> the Switch backward and forward to animate the Horse
with the Sound, is a graceful Aid; but till a Horse is accustom'd to
it, it is apt to drive him forward too much.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> case your Horse is too light and nimble with his Croupe,
you must aid before only with the Switch; if he bends or sinks his
Croupe, or tosses it about without kicking out, you must aid just at
the Setting on of the Tail.&mdash;If you would have him make Croupades, give
him the Switch a little above the Hocks.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">To</span> aid with your Tongue, you must turn it upward against
the Palate of the Mouth, shut your Teeth, and then remove it from
your Palate; the Noise it makes is admirable to encourage a Horse, to
quicken and put him together; but you must not use it continually,
for so, instead of animating your Horse, it would serve only to lull
him.&mdash;There are People who when they work their Horses, whistle and
make use of their Voices; these Aids are ridiculous, we should leave
these Habits to Grooms and Coachmen,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span> and know that Crys and Threats
are useless.&mdash;The Sense of hearing can serve at the most only to
confound and surprize a Horse, and you will never give him Exactness
and Sensibility by surprizing him.&mdash;The same may be said of the Sight;
whatever strikes this Sense, operates likewise upon the Memory, and
this Method seldom produces a good Effect; for you ought to know how
important it is to vary the Order of your Lessons, and the Places
where you give them; since it is certain, that a Horse who is always
work'd in the same Place, works by rote, and attends no longer to the
Aids of the Hand and Heels.&mdash;It is the same with hot and angry Horses,
whose Memory is so exact, and who are so ready to be disorder'd and
put out of Humour, that if the least thing comes in their Way during
their Lesson, they no longer think of what they were about: The way of
dealing with these Horses, is to work them with Lunettes on their Eyes;
but it must be remembered, that this Method would be dangerous with
Horses which are very impatient, hot, and averse to all Subjection,
and so sensible to the Aids, as to grow desperate to such a degree, as
to break through all Restraint, and run away headlong; it is therefore
unsafe with these Horses, because they could not be more blinded even
with the Lunettes, than they are when possessed with this Madness,
which so blinds them, that they no longer fear the most apparent
Dangers.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Having</span> said thus much of the Aids which operate upon the
Touch, Hearing and Sight, we must now confine ourselves to discourse
upon those, which regard the Touch only; for as it has been already
said, these only are the Aids<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span> by which a Horse can be drest, because
it is only by the Hand and Heel that he can be adjusted.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Horseman's Legs, by being kept near the Horse's Sides,
serve not only to embellish his Seat, but without keeping them in this
Posture, he never will be able to give his Aids justly.&mdash;To explain
this: If the Motion of my Leg is made at a distance from the Horse, it
is rather a Correction than an Aid, and alarms and disorders the Horse;
on the contrary, if my Leg is near the Part that is most sensible, the
Horse may be aided, advertised of his Fault, and even punished, in
much less time, and consequently by this means kept in a much greater
Degree of Obedience.&mdash;The Legs furnish us with four Sorts of Aids, the
Inside of the Knees, the Calfs, pinching delicately with the Spurs, and
pressing strongly upon the Stirrups. The essential Article in dressing
a Horse, is to make known the Gradation of these several Aids, which I
will explain. The Aid of the Inside of the Knees is given, by closing
and squeezing your Knees, in such a manner, that you feel them press
and grasp your Horse extremely. You aid with the Calfs of your Legs, by
bending your Knees, so as to bring your Calfs so close as to touch the
Horse with them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Aid of Pinching with the Spurs, is performed in the same
manner, by bending your Knees, and touching with the Spurs the Hair
of the Horse, without piercing the Skin. The last Aid, which is only
proper for very sensible and delicate Horses, consists in stretching
down your Legs, and pressing firm upon the Stirrups.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span><span class="smcap">The</span> strongest Aid is that of pinching with the Spur; the next
in degree, is applying the Calf of the Leg; pressing with the Knees
is the third, and leaning upon the Stirrup is the last and least;
but if these Aids are given injudiciously, they will have no Effect.
They must accompany and keep Pace with the Hand; for it is the just
Correspondence between the Heel and Hand, in which the Truth and
Delicacy of the Art consists; and without this Agreement there can be
no riding.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is the Foundation of all Justness; it constitutes and
directs the Cadence, Measure and Harmony of all the Airs; it is the
Soul of Delicacy, Brilliancy and Truth in riding; and as a Person
who plays upon a musical Instrument adapts and suits his two Hands
equally to the Instrument, so the Man who works a Horse ought to make
his Hands and Legs accord exactly together. I say his Hands and Legs
should accord and answer one to the other with the strictest Exactness,
because the nicest and most subtle Effects of the Bridle proceed
entirely from this Agreement; and however fine and nice a Touch a
Horseman may be endued with, if the Times of aiding with the Legs are
broken and imperfect, he never can have a good Hand; because it is
evident that a good Hand is not the Offspring only of a firm and good
Seat, but owing likewise to the Proportion and Harmony of all the Aids
together. I understand by the Harmony and Agreement of the Aids, the
Art of knowing how to seize the Moment in which they are to be given,
and of giving them equally and in a due Degree, as well as of measuring
and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span> comparing the Action of the Hand and Legs together; by which both
these Parts being made to act together, and in time, will create and
call out, as it were, those Cadences and Equalities of Time, of which
the finest Airs are compos'd; Measures and Cadences which it is not
possible to describe, but which every Horseman ought to comprehend,
attend to, and feel. If I want to make my Horse go forward, I yield my
Hand to him, and at the same time close my Legs; the Hand ceasing to
confine, and the Legs driving on his hinder Parts, the Horse obeys. I
have a mind to stop him, I hold him in, and approach my Legs to his
Sides gently, in order to proportion my Aids to what I ask him to do;
for I would not have it felt more than just to make him stop upon his
Haunches.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">I want</span> to turn him to the Left, I carry my Hand to the Left,
and support him at the same time; that is to say, I approach my
Left-leg, my Hand then guides the Horse to the Left, and my Leg, which
operates at the same time, helps him to turn; because by driving his
Croupe to the Right, his Shoulder is enabled to turn with more Ease. I
want to go to the Right, I carry my Hand to the Right, and I support
him with my Right-hand, my Leg determining his Croupe to the Left,
facilitates the Action of the Shoulder which my Hand had turned to the
Right.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">I would</span> make a Change to the Right, my Left-rein directs
the Horse, and my Left-leg at the same time confines his Croupe, so
that it can't escape, but must follow the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span> Shoulders.&mdash;I would change
Hands again to the Left, my Right-rein then guides the Horse, and
my Right-leg does just the same as my Left-leg did in going to the
Right.&mdash;I undertake to work the Shoulder and Croupe at the same time;
for this Purpose I carry my Hand <i>out</i>.&mdash;The inner Rein acts, and the
outward Leg of the Horse is press'd, either by this Rein, or by my
outward Leg, so that the outward Rein operates upon the Shoulder, and
the inner Rein with my outward Leg directs the Croupe.&mdash;I put my Horse
to Curvets.&mdash;I aid him with my outward Rein, and if he is not enough
upon his Haunches, my Legs, accompanied with the inner Rein, aid me to
put him more upon them; if he turns his Croupe out, I aid and support
him with my outward Leg; if he flings it in too much, I confine him
with my inner Leg.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">I put</span> him to make Curvets sideways, my outward Rein brings his
outward Shoulder in, because the outward Shoulder being brought in, his
Croupe is left at liberty; but if I have occasion I use my inner Rein,
and if his Croupe is not sufficiently confin'd, I support it with my
outward Leg.&mdash;Again, I put him to make Curvets backwards, I use then my
outward Rein, and keep my Hand near my Body. At each Cadence that the
Horse makes, I make him feel a <i>Time</i>; one, and every time he comes to
the Ground, I receive and catch him as it were in my Hand; but these
<i>Times</i> ought not to be distant above an Inch or two at the most; I
then ease my Legs to him, which nevertheless I approach insensibly
every time he rises. Thus by making my Hands and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span> Legs act together, I
learn not only to work a Horse with Justness and Precision, but even to
dress him to all the Airs; which I shall speak of distinctly and more
at large.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">As</span> to the rest, be it remember'd, that it is not alone
sufficient to know how to unite your Aids, and to proportion them,
as well as the Corrections, to the Motions and the Faults in the
Horse's Air, which you would remedy; but whenever you are to make use
of them, you must consider likewise if they are suitable and adapted
to the Nature of the Horse; for otherwise they will not only prove
ineffectual, but be the Occasion even of many Disorders.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAP_X" id="CHAP_X"></a>CHAP. X.<br />
<i>Of the Passage.</i></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span><span class="smcap">The</span> Passage is the Key which opens to us all the Justness of
the Art of riding, and is the only Means of adjusting and regulating
Horses in all sorts of Airs; because in this Action you may work them
slowly, and teach them all the Knowledge of the Leg and Hand, as it
were insensibly, and without running any risque of disgusting them, so
as to make them rebel.&mdash;There are many sorts of the Passage: In that
which is derived from the Trot, the Action of the Horse's Legs is the
same as in the Trot; the Passage is only distinguish'd from the Trot,
which is the Foundation of it, by the extreme Union of the Horse,
and by his keeping his Legs longer in the Air, and lifting them both
equally high, and being neither so quick nor violent as in the Action
of the Trot.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the Passage which is founded on the Walk, the Action of the
Horse is the same as in the Trot, and of consequence the same as in
the Walk; with this Difference, that the Horse lifts his Fore-feet a
good deal higher than his Hind-feet, that he <i>marks</i> a certain Time or
Interval sufficiently long between the Motion of each Leg; his Action
being much more together and short, and more distinct and slow than the
ordinary Walk, and not so extended as in the Trot, in such a manner
that he is, as it were, kept together and supported under himself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span><span class="smcap">Lastly</span>, there is another sort of Passage to which the Trot
likewise gives birth, and in which the Action is so quick, so diligent,
and so supported, that the Horse seems not to advance, but to work
upon the same Spot of Ground. The <i>Spaniards</i> call the Horses who make
this sort of Passage <i>Pissadores</i>. This sort of Horses have not their
Action so high and strong as the other, it being too quick and sudden;
but almost all Horses which are inclin'd to this sort of Passage, are
generally endowed with a great Share of Gentleness and Activity.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">No</span> Horse should be put to the Passage till he has been
well trotted out, is supple, and has acquir'd some Knowledge of the
<i>Union</i>.&mdash;If he has not been well trotted, and by that means taught
to go forward readily, his Action, when put to the Passage, being
shorten'd and retain'd, you would run the risque of his becoming
<i>restive</i> and <i>ramingue</i>; and was he utterly unacquainted with the
Union, the Passage requiring that he should be very much together,
he would not be able to bear it; so that finding himself press'd and
forced on one hand, and being incapable of obeying on the other, he
would resist and defend himself.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">There</span> are some People, who observing a Horse to have Strength
and Agility, and naturally disposed to unite himself, endeavour to get
from him some <i>Times</i> of the Passage.&mdash;They succeed in their Attempt,
and immediately conclude that they can passage their Horse whenever
they will, and so press him to it, before he has been sufficiently
suppled and taught to go forward readily, and without retaining
himself.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span> &mdash;Hence arise all the Disorders into which Horses plunge
themselves, which, if they had been properly managed at first, would
have been innocent of all Vice.&mdash;Farther, you ought to study well the
Nature of every Horse; you will discover of what Temper he is from the
first Moment you see him passage, and to what he is most inclin'd by
Nature.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">If</span> he has any Seeds of the <i>Ramingue</i> in him, his Action
will be short and <i>together</i>; but it will be retain'd and loitering,
the Horse craving the Aids, and only advancing in proportion as the
Rider gives them, and drives him forward.&mdash;If he is light and active,
quick of Feeling, and willing, his Action will be free and diligent,
and you will perceive that he takes a Pleasure to work of himself,
without expecting the Aids.&mdash;If he be of a hot and fiery Nature, his
Actions will be quick and sudden, and will shew that he is angry and
impatient of the Subjection. If he wants Inclination and Will, he will
be unquiet, he will cross his Legs, and his Actions will be perplex'd.
If he is fiery, and heavy at the same time, his Action will be all upon
the Hand. If besides this, he has but little Strength, he will abandon
himself entirely upon the <i>Apuy</i>. Lastly, if he is cold and sluggish
in his Nature, his Motion will be unactive and dead; and even when he
is enliven'd by good Lessons, you will always be able to discover his
Temper by seeing the Aids, which the Rider is oblig'd to give him from
time to time, to hinder him from slackening or stopping the <i>Cadence</i>
of his Passage.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Having</span> acquir'd a thorough Knowledge of your Horse's
Character, you should regulate all your Lessons and Proceedings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
conformable to it.&mdash;If it hurts a Horse who partakes of the <i>Ramingue</i>
to be kept too much together, unite him by little and little, and
insensibly as it were, and quite contrary to putting him to a short and
united Passage all at once. Extend and push him forward, passing one
while from the Walk to that of the Trot, and so alternatively.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">If</span> your Horse is hot and impatient, he will cross his Steps,
and not go equal; keep such a Horse in a less degree of Subjection,
ease his Rein, pacify him, and retain or hold him in no more than is
sufficient to make him more quiet.&mdash;If with this he is heavy, put him
to a Walk somewhat shorter and slower than the Passage, and endeavour
to put him upon his Haunches insensibly, and by degrees. By these means
you will be enabled by Art to bring him to an Action, by so much the
more essential, as by this alone a Horse is taught to know the Hands
and Heels, as I have already observed, without ever being perplex'd or
disordered.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAP_XI" id="CHAP_XI"></a>CHAP. XI.<br />
<i>Of working with the Head and Croupe to the Wall.</i></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span><span class="smcap">The</span> Lessons of the Head and Croupe to the Wall are excellent
to confirm a Horse in Obedience. In effect, when in this Action he
is, as it were, balanced between the Rider's Legs, and by working
the Croupe along the Wall, you are enabled not only to supple his
Shoulders, but likewise to teach him the Aids of the Legs.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">For</span> this Purpose, after having well open'd the Corner, turn
your Hand immediately, and carry it <i>in</i>, in order to direct your Horse
by your outward Rein; taking always care to support the Croupe with
your outward Leg directly over-against, and about two Feet distant
from the Wall: Bend your Horse to the Way he goes, and draw back the
Shoulder that is <i>in</i> with your inner Rein, because the outward Leg
being carried with more care over the inner Leg by means of the outward
Rein, the Horse will cross and bring one Leg over the other, the
Shoulders will go before the Croupe, you will narrow him behind, and
consequently put him upon his Haunches.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">You</span> ought to be careful at the same time, and see that your
Horse never falsifies or quits the Line, either in advancing or going
backward.&mdash;If he presses forward, support him with your Hand; if he
hangs back, support him with your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span> Legs, always giving him the Leg that
serves to drive him on, stronger than the other which serves only to
support him; that is, acting stronger with the Leg that is <i>without</i>,
than with that which is within.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Lesson of the Head to the Wall is very efficacious to
correct a Horse that forces the Hand, or who leans heavily upon it,
because it compels him to put himself together, and be light upon the
Hand with less Aids of the Bridle; but no Horse that is <i>restive</i> or
<i>ramingue</i> should be put to it, for all narrow and confin'd Lessons
serve only to confirm them in their natural Vice.&mdash;Place your Horse
directly opposite the Wall, at about two Feet distance from it; make
him go sideways, as I have already directed in the Article of Croupe to
the Wall; but left one Foot should tread upon the other, and he should
knock them together and hurt himself, in the Beginning of both Lessons
you must not be too strict with him, but let his Croupe be rather on
the contrary Side of his Shoulders, since by this means he will look
towards the Way he is going more easily, and be better able to raise
the Shoulder and Leg which is to cross over the other.&mdash;By degrees you
will gain his Haunches, and he will grow supple before and behind,
and at the same time become light in the Hand: Never forget that your
Horse ought always to be bent to the Way he goes; in order to do this
readily, guide him with the outward Rein; for very often the Stiffness
of the Neck or Head is owing to nothing but the confined Action of the
outward Shoulder; it being certain, that either the Difficulty or Ease
of working either of those Parts, depends entirely upon the other;
your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span> Horse going thus sideways, carry your Hand a little out from
time to time; the inner Rein by this means will be shortened, and make
the Horse look <i>in</i>, the more it enlarges him before, by keeping his
Fore-leg that is <i>in</i>, at a distance from the Fore-leg that is <i>out</i>,
which consequently bringing the inner Hinder-leg near to the outward,
confines his hinder Parts, and makes him bend his Haunches, especially
the outward, upon which he rests his Weight, and keeps him in an equal
Balance.&mdash;Never put your Horse to this Lesson, till he has been work'd
a long while upon large Circles, his Head <i>in</i>, or to the Center, and
his Croupe <i>out</i>; otherwise you would run the Risque of throwing him
into great Disorder.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> greater part of Defences proceed from the Shoulders or
Haunches, that is to say, from the fore or hinder Parts; and thence the
Horse learns to resist the Hand or Heel. It is the want of Suppleness
then, that hinders the Horse from executing what you put him to do; and
how can it be expected that he should answer and obey, when he is stiff
in the Shoulders, Haunches, and Ribs? especially if, without reflecting
that Suppleness is the Foundation of all, you press and teize him, and
put him to Lessons beyond his Power and Capacity.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAP_XII" id="CHAP_XII"></a>CHAP. XII.<br />
<i>Of Changes of the Hand, large and narrow, and of Voltes and
Demi-voltes.</i></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span><span class="smcap">A Change</span> is that Action, whereby the Horseman guides and
causes his Horse to go from the Right-hand to the Left, and from
the Left to the Right, in order to work him equally to both Hands;
therefore changing the Hand, when you are to the Right, is making your
Horse go to the Left-hand, and when on the Left, making him go to the
Right. The Changes are made either on one <i>Line</i> or <i>Path</i>, or on two,
and are either large or narrow. Changing the Hand upon one Line, is
when the Horse describes but one Line with his Feet; changing upon two
Lines, is when the Haunches follow and accompany the Shoulders; and
to make this Change, the Horse's Feet must consequently describe two
Lines, one made by his Fore-feet, the other with his Hinder-feet.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Changing</span> large, is when the Line, if the Horse makes but one,
or both Lines, when he describes two, cross the Manage from Corner to
Corner; changing narrow, is when these Lines pass over but a Part of it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A</span> <i>Volte</i> is generally defined to be whatever forms a
Circle.&mdash;Voltes of two Lines or Paths, describe two, one with the
Horse's Fore, the other with his Hinder-feet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span><span class="smcap">If</span> the Circle then forms a Volte, by consequence half a Circle
forms what is called the <i>Half-volte</i>.&mdash;These Half-voltes, and Quarters
of Voltes, are made upon two Lines, as well as the Volte.&mdash;A Demi-volte
of two Treads, is nothing else than two half Circles, one drawn by
the Horse's Fore-feet, the other by the Hinder; it is the same with
Quarters of Voltes.&mdash;A Horse can be work'd, and put to all sorts of
Airs upon the Voltes, Half-voltes, and Quarters of Voltes.&mdash;But as the
Rules necessary to be observed and followed in making Voltes of two
Treads, and in changing of Hands in the Passage, are only general, I
shall content myself with explaining them in this Chapter; reserving
to myself a Power of pointing out the Exceptions, when I shall come
to treat of the different Airs, and the different Manages, that are
practised upon the Voltes. Three things equally essential, and equally
difficult to attain, must concur to form the Justness of a Change; they
are the manner of beginning it, of continuing, and closing it.&mdash;We
will suppose you in the Manage, you walk your Horse forward, you bend
him properly, and you are come to the Place where you intend to change
large. For this Purpose, make a half Stop, and take care never to
abandon the Rein which is to bend your Horse's Neck; the other Rein,
that is, the outward Rein, is that, which you must use to guide and
direct him, but you must proportion the Stress you lay upon one with
the other.&mdash;As it is the outward Rein which determines your Horse the
Way he is to go, make that operate, its Effect will be to bring the
outward Shoulder <i>in</i>; if then it brings the outward Shoulder <i>in</i>, it
guides and determines the Horse to the Side to which you are going,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
and confines and fixes the Croupe at the same time. This is not all,
at the same Instant that your Hand operates, support your Horse with
your outward Leg: Your Hand having determined the Shoulder, and fixed
the Croupe, your Leg must help to secure it; for without the Aid of the
Leg, the Croupe would be unconfined, would be lost, and the Horse would
work only upon one Line. You see then, how requisite it is for the
Horseman to be exact, active, and to give his Aids with the greatest
Delicacy, in order to <i>begin</i> his Change with Justness; because it is
necessary, that the Times of giving the Hand and Leg, should be so
close one to the other, as not to be perceived or distinguished.&mdash;You
should never abandon, I have already said, that Rein with which you
bend your Horse; this is the Reason&mdash;Every Horse when he makes a
Change, ought to look towards the Way he is going; this Turn of the
Neck, this Attitude, enables him to perform his Work better, and makes
him appear graceful in it; therefore if he is turned or bent before
he begins to change, why should you abandon the Rein that serves to
bend him; since in this case, you would be under a double Difficulty
in wanting on one hand the Point of Apuy, which ought to be found in
the Rein which serves to bend him, and the Point of Apuy which ought
to result from the working of the other Rein, which is to determine
him.&mdash;The outward Rein operates to bring in the outward Shoulder, your
outward Leg accompanies the Action of your Hand; here then is your
Change begun.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span><span class="smcap">The</span> outward Shoulder and Leg never could have been brought
in, without passing over or crossing the inner Leg and Shoulder; this
is the Action which the outward Leg should constantly perform through
the whole Change. In order to arrive at a just Execution of this, you
should be able to feel which Feet are off the Ground, and which are
upon it. If the inner Leg is in the Air, and the Horse is ready to put
it to the Ground, raise your Hand, and carry it <i>in</i> insensibly, and
your Horse will be oblig'd to advance his outward Leg and Shoulder,
which must by this means cross the inner Leg and Shoulder whether he
will or no.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is not sufficient for the Horse to cross his Legs only one
over the other, he must go forward likewise at the same time, because
in making the Change large, his Feet should describe two diagonal
Lines.&mdash;It is of Importance therefore, that the same Attention be had
to the inner as the outward Leg, for it is by the means of his Legs
only that he can advance. It is true that you should endeavour to make
him go forward by putting back your Body, and yielding your Hand; but
if he won't obey these Aids, you must make use of the Calfs of your
Legs, aiding more strongly with your Left-leg when you are going to the
Right-hand, and more strongly with your Right-leg when you are going to
the Left. Besides, it is so necessary to have an equal Attention to the
Legs, because the Horse could never work with Justness, if he were not
ballanced equally between the Rider's Legs; and it is from this exact
Obedience only, that he is enabled to make the Changes with Precision,
because without a Knowledge of the Hand and Heels, it is impossible he
should obey the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span> Motions of his Rider&mdash;In order to <i>close</i> the Change
justly, the Horses Fore-legs should arrive at the same time upon a
strait Line; so that a Change justly executed, and in the same Cadence
or Time, is such, as is not only begun, but finish'd likewise, and
closed in such a Proportion, that the Croupe always accompanies and
keeps Pace with the Shoulders throughout.&mdash;In order to finish it in
this manner, you must observe the following Rules. The greater Number
of Horses, instead of finishing their Changes with Exactness, are apt
to lean on one Side, to make their Croupe go before their Shoulders,
and to throw themselves with Impatience, in order to get upon one
Line again; the Method of correcting them for these Irregularities,
is to make a Demi-volte of two Lines, in the same Place where they
were to have closed their Change; for Example, if in changing to the
Right, they are too eager to come upon the strait Line, without having
properly finish'd their Change, demand of them a Demi-volte to the
Left, which you must make them round equally with their Shoulders and
Haunches.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">An</span> essential Point, which nevertheless is little regarded, is
the making your Horse resume his Line, or go off again to the other
Hand, when he has made his Change. To make him do this, you must carry
your Hand to the Side to which you have closed your Change, and carry
it insensibly as it were, after which you will be able with great Ease
to bend your Horse to the Inside. I must further explain the Necessity
of this Action.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span><span class="smcap">It</span> is evident that a Horse in the Passage, neither can, nor
ought if he could, move the two Feet on the same Side together. In
beginning and finishing the Change, the outward Leg and Shoulder pass
and cross over the inner Leg and Shoulder; he is consequently supported
in this Action on the outward Haunch, for the inner Foot behind was off
the Ground; now, if at the Closing of the Change, and in the Instant
that he is again upon one Line; as for Example&mdash;If in closing his
Change to the Right, the Horse is supported in this Action by the left
Haunch, how is it possible that he can be bent to the Left? To attempt
this, would be to make him move two Legs on the same Side, which would
be undertaking a thing impossible to be done. Being therefore arrived
upon one Line, carry your Hand to the Wall, this will make your Horse
change his Leg; he will be supported in his Action by his right Haunch,
and will be able to bend himself with great Facility.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> order to make the Volte true and perfect, he ought to be
just with respect to his Head and Neck, and have the Action of his
Shoulders and Haunches quite equal. When I say that a Horse should have
his Shoulders and Haunches equal, I would not be understood to mean,
that his Fore-feet should not cover more Ground than his Hinder; on
the contrary, I know it is a Rule never to be departed from, that his
Shoulders should precede half of the Haunches; but I insist that the
Haunches should go along with, and follow exactly the Motion of, the
Shoulders; for 'tis from their Agreement, and from the Harmony between
the Hind-legs and the Fore, upon which the Truth of the Volte<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span> depends.
The four Legs of a Horse may be compared to the four Strings of an
Instrument; if these four Cords don't correspond, it is impossible
there should be any Musick; it is the same with a Horse, if the Motions
of his Haunches and Fore-legs don't act together and assist each other,
and if he has not acquired a Habit and Ease to perform what he ought to
do, the most expert and dextrous Horseman will never be able to acquit
himself as he ought, nor execute any Air justly and with Pleasure, be
it either on the Volte or strait forward.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Whenever</span> you put your Horse to the Passage upon the Voltes,
he ought to make the same Number of Steps or Times with his Hinder, as
with his Fore-feet; if the Space of the Ground upon which he works is
narrow and confin'd, his Steps should be shorter.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">I will</span> suppose that he describes a large Circle with his
Fore-feet; the Action of his outward Shoulder ought consequently to
be free, and the Shoulder much advanced, in order to make the outward
Leg pass over and cross at every Step the inner Leg, that he may more
easily embrace his Volte, without quitting the Line of the Circle, and
without disordering his Hinder-leg; which ought likewise to be subject
to the same Laws as the Fore-legs, and cross the outward Leg over
the inner, but not so much as the Fore-legs, because they have less
Ground to go over, and should only keep the Proportion.&mdash;In working
upon Voltes of two Lines, the Horse should make as many Steps with his
Hinder as with his Fore-feet; because those Horses whose Haunches go
before the Shoulders, and who cut and shorten the exact Line of the
Volte,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span> are apt to keep their Hinder-feet in one Place, and make at
the same time one or two Steps with their Fore-feet, and by this means
falsify and avoid filling up the Circle in the Proportion they begun
it. The same Fault is to be found with Horses who hang back at the End
of a Change, and throwing out their Croupe, arrive at the Wall with
their Shoulders, and consequently fail to close their Change justly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Further</span>, in working upon this Lesson, it is indispensably
necessary that at every Step the Horse takes, he should make his
outward Leg cross and come over the inner, because this will prevent a
Horse that is too quick of Feeling, or one, that is <i>ramingue</i>, from
becoming <i>entier</i>, or to bend himself, or lean in his Voltes, Vices
that are occasion'd from having the Haunches or Hinder-legs too much
constrain'd. There are Horses likewise who have their Croupe so light
and uncertain, that from the Moment they have begun the Volte, they
lean and widen their Hinder-legs, and throw them out of the Volte.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">To</span> remedy this, aid with the outward Leg, carrying your
Bridle-hand to the same Side, and not <i>in</i>, because it is by the Means
of the outward Leg and inner Rein, that you will be enabled to adjust
and bring in the Croupe upon the Line which it ought to keep.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">If</span> it happens that the Horse don't keep up to the Line of
his Volte, or throws his Croupe out, press him forward, letting
him go strait on two or three Steps, keeping him firm in the Hand,
and in a slow and just Time, and use the Aids which I have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span> just
now directed.&mdash;This Lesson is equally useful in case your Horse is
naturally inclin'd to carry his Haunches too much in, and where he is
<i>ramingue</i>, or in danger of becoming so; but then the Aids must be
given on the Side to which he leans, and presses, in order to widen his
Hinder-parts, and to push the Croupe out.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Above</span> all you should remember, that whatever tends to bend or
turn the Head on one side, will always drive the Croupe on the other;
when the Horse's Croupe don't follow his Shoulders equally, the Fault
may proceed either from a Disobedience to the Hand, or from his not
answering the Heels as he ought. If you would remedy this, keep him low
before; that is to say, keep your Bridle-hand very low, and while you
make him advance upon two Treads, aid him firmly with the Calfs of the
Legs; for as the outward Leg will confine and keep his Croupe <i>in</i>, the
inner Leg, operating with the outward, will make him go forward.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">If</span> you find that your Horse disobeys the Heel, and throws
his Croupe out in spite of that Aid, in this Case make use of your
inner Rein, carrying your Hand out with your Nails turned upwards;
this will infallibly operate upon the Croupe, and restrain it. Use the
same Remedy, if in the Passage your Horse carries his Head out of the
Volte, and you will bring it in; but you must remember, in both Cases,
to replace your Hand immediately after having carried it out, in order
to make the outward Rein work, which will facilitate and enable the
outward Legs to cross over the inner.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span><span class="smcap">If</span> the Horse breaks the Line, and flings his Croupe upon
the Right-heel, work him to that Side with your Left; if he would go
sideways to the Left, make him go to the Right; if he flings his Croupe
<i>out</i>, put it quietly <i>in</i>; in short, if all at once he brings it <i>in</i>,
put it quietly <i>out</i>; and, in a word, teach him by the Practice of
good Lessons to acquire a Facility and Habit of executing whatever you
demand of him.</p>

<p><i>The</i> Consequence of all the different Rules and Principles, which I
have here laid down, and which may be applied equally to the Changes,
large and narrow, to Changes upon the Voltes, and Half-voltes;
the Consequence of these Instructions I say will be, if practised
judiciously, a most implicit and exact Obedience on the Part of the
Horse, who from that Moment, will resign his own Will and Inclination,
and make it subservient to that of the Rider, which he must teach him
to know by making him acquainted with the Hand and Heel.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAP_XIII" id="CHAP_XIII"></a>CHAP. XIII.<br />
<i>Of the Aids of the Body.</i></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span><span class="smcap">The</span> Perfection of all the Aids consists, as I have already
proved, in their mutual Harmony and Correspondence, for without this
Agreement, they must be always ineffectual; because the Horse can never
work with Exactness and Delicacy, and keep the Proportion and Measure
which is inseparable to all Airs, when justly and beautifully executed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> Maxim being laid down, we shall undertake to demonstrate,
that the Aids of the Body contribute, and are even capable of
themselves, from the Principles of Geometry, to make us acquire the
Union of the Aids of the Hand and Leg; and if so, we shall be obliged
to own the Conclusion, that they are to be prefer'd to all the rest.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Justness of the Aids of the Body depends upon the Seat of
the Horseman.&mdash;Till he is arrived at the Point of being able to sit
down close and firm in his Saddle, so as to be immoveable in it, it
would be vain to expect he should be able to manage a Horse; because,
besides that he would be incapable of feeling his Motions, he would
not be possessed of that Equilibre and Firmness of Seat, which is the
Characteristic of a Horseman. I would define the Equilibre to be, when
the Horseman sits upon his Twist,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span> directly down and close upon the
Saddle, and so firm that nothing can loosen or disturb his Seat; and by
Firmness, I express that Grasp or Hold with which he keeps himself on
the Horse, without employing any Strength, but trusting entirely to his
Ballance, to humour and accompany all the Motions of the Horse.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nothing</span> but Exercise and Practice can give this Equilibre, and
consequently this Hold upon the Horse. In the Beginning, the Fear which
almost every Scholar feels, and the Constraint which all his Limbs are
under, make him apt to press the Saddle very close with his Thighs and
Knees, as he imagines he shall by this Method acquire a firmer Seat;
but the very Efforts that he makes to resist the Motions of the Horse,
stiffen his Body, and lift him out of the Saddle, so that any rude
Motion, or unexpected Shock, would be likely to unhorse him; for from
the Moment that he ceases to sit down and quite close to the Saddle,
every sudden Jirk and Motion of the Horse attacking him under his
Twist, must shove him out of the Saddle.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">We</span> will suppose then a Person, the Position of whose Body is
just and regular, and who, by being able to sit down perpendicular and
full in his Saddle, can feel and unite himself to his Horse so as to
accompany all his Motions; let us see then how this Person, from the
Motions of his own Body, will be able to accord and unite the Aids or
Times of the Hands and Legs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span><span class="smcap">In</span> order to make your Horse take or go into the Corner of the
Manage, you must begin by <i>opening</i> it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">To</span> open a Corner, is to turn the Shoulder before you come to
it, in order to make it cover the Ground; and then the Croupe which
is turn'd <i>in</i> will not follow the Line of the Shoulders, till they
are turn'd and brought upon a strait Line in order to come out of
the Corner.&mdash;In order to turn the Shoulder to open the Corner, you
must carry your Hand to the Right or Left, according to the Hand to
which you are to go; and to throw in the Croupe, you must support it
with the Leg on that Side to which you carry your Hand.&mdash;To make the
Shoulders turn and come out of the Corner, you must carry your Hand on
the Side opposite to that to which you turned it, in order to go into
the Corner; and that the Croupe may pass over the same Ground as the
Shoulders, you must support with the Leg on the contrary Side to that
with which you aided in order to bring the Haunches in; the Horse never
can perform any of these Actions without an entire Agreement of all
these Aids, and one single Motion of the Body will be sufficient to
unite them all with the utmost Exactness.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> effect, instead of carrying your Hand out, and seconding
that Aid with the Leg, turn your Body but imperceptibly towards the
Corner, just as if you intended to go into it yourself; your Body
then turning to the Right or Left, your Hand, which is one of its
Appurtenances, must necessarily turn likewise, and the Leg of the Side
on which you turn, will infallibly press against the Horse, and aid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
him.&mdash;If you would come out of the Corner, turn your Body again, your
Hand will follow it, and your other Leg approaching the Horse, will
put his Croupe into the Corner, in such a manner, that it will follow
the Shoulders, and be upon the same Line.&mdash;It is by these means that
you will be enabled to time the Aids of the Hand and Legs with greater
Exactness, than you could do, were you not to move your Body; for how
dextrous and ready soever you may be, yet when you only use your Hand
and Legs, without letting their Aids proceed from, and be guided by
your Body, they can never operate so effectually, and their Action is
infinitely less smooth, and not so measured and proportioned, as when
it proceeds only from the Motion of the Body.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> same Motion of the Body is likewise necessary in turning
entirely to the Right or Left, or to make your Horse go sideways on one
Line, or in making the Changes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">If</span> when you make a Change, you perceive the Croupe to be
too much <i>in</i>, by turning your Body <i>in</i>, you will drive it out, and
the Hand following the Body, determines the Shoulder by means of the
outward Rein, which is shorten'd; if the Croupe is too much <i>out</i>, turn
your Body <i>out</i>, and this Posture carrying the Hand out, shortens the
inner Rein, and confines the Croupe, acting in concert with the outward
Leg, which works and approaches the Side of the Horse.&mdash;This Aid is by
so much better, because if executed with Delicacy, it is imperceptible,
and never alarms the Horse; I say, if executed as it ought to be, for
we are not talking here of turning the Shoulder, and so falsifying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
the Posture. In order to make the Hand and Leg work together, it is
necessary that the Motion should proceed from the Horseman, which
in turning carries with it the rest of the Body insensibly; without
this, very far from being assisted by the Ballance of your Body in
the Saddle, you would lose it entirely, and together with it the
Gracefulness of your Seat; and your Ballance being gone, how can you
expect to find any Justness in the Motions of your Horse, since all the
Justness and Beauty of his Motions must depend upon the Exactness of
your own?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> secret Aids of the Body are such then as serve to prevent,
and accompany all the Motions of the Horse. If you will make him go
backward, throw back your own Body, your Hand will go with it, and you
will make the Horse obey by a single Turn of the Waist.&mdash;Would you have
him go forward, for this purpose put your Body back, but in a less
degree; don't press the Horse's Fore-parts with your Weight, because
by leaning a little back you will be able to approach your Legs to
his Sides with greater Ease.&mdash;If your Horse rises up, bend your Body
forward; if he kicks, leaps, or strikes out behind, throw your Body
back; if he gallops when he should not, oppose all his Motions, and for
this purpose push your Waist forward towards the Pummel of the Saddle,
making a Bend or Hollow at the same time in your Loins: In short, do
you work your Horse upon great Circles, with the Head <i>in</i> and Croupe
<i>out</i>? let your Body then be a Part of the Circle, because this Posture
bringing your Hand <i>in</i>, you bring in the Horse's outward Shoulder,
over which the inner Shoulder crosses circularly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span> and your inner Leg
being likewise by this Method near your Horse's Side, you leave his
Croupe at liberty. I call it becoming a Part of the Circle yourself,
when you incline a little the Balance of your Body towards the Center;
and this Balance proceeds entirely from the outward Hip, and turning it
<i>in</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Aids of the Body then are those which conduce to make
the Horse work with greater Pleasure, and consequently perform his
Business with more Grace; if then they are such, as to be capable alone
of constituting the Justness of the Airs; if they unite, and make the
Hand and Legs work in concert; if they are so fine and subtle, as to
be imperceptible, and occasion no visible Motion in the Rider, but the
Horse seems to work of himself; if they comprize at the same time, the
most established and certain Principles of the Art; if the Body of
the Horseman, which is capable of employing them, is of consequence
firm without Constraint or Stiffness, and supple without being weak
or loose; if these are the Fruits which we derive from them, we must
fairly own, that this is the shortest, the most certain, and plainest
Method we can follow, in order to form a Horseman.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAP_XIV" id="CHAP_XIV"></a>CHAP. XIV.<br />
<i>Of the Gallop.</i></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span><span class="smcap">The</span> Trot is the Foundation of the Gallop; the Proof of
its being so is very clear and natural. The Action of the Trot is
crosswise, that of the Gallop is from an equal Motion of the Fore and
Hinder-legs; now, if you trot out your Horse briskly and beyond his
Pitch, he will be compell'd when his Fore-feet are off the Ground, to
put his Hinder-foot down so quick, that it will follow the Fore-foot
of the same Side; and it is this which forms the true Gallop: The Trot
then is beyond dispute the Foundation of the Gallop.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">As</span> the Perfection of the Trot consists in the Suppleness of
the Joints and Limbs, that of the Gallop depends upon the Lightness and
Activity of the Shoulders; a good Apuy, and the Vigour and Resolution
of the Career, must depend upon the natural Spirit and Courage of the
Horse. It should be a Rule, never to make a Horse gallop, till he
presents and offers to do it of himself.&mdash;Trotting him out boldly and
freely, and keeping him in the Hand, so as to raise and support his
Fore-parts, will assist him greatly; for when his Limbs are become
supple and ready, and he is so far advanced, as to be able to unite and
put himself together without Difficulty, he will then go off readily in
his Gallop; whereas, if on the contrary he should pull<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span> or be heavy,
the Gallop would only make him abandon himself upon the Hand, and fling
him entirely upon his Shoulders.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">To</span> put a Horse in the Beginning of his Lessons from the Walk
to the Gallop, and to work him in it upon Circles, is demanding of him
too great a degree of Obedience. In the first place, it is very sure
that the Horse can unite himself with greater Ease in going strait
forward, than in turning; and, in the next place, the Walk being a slow
and distinct Pace, and the Gallop being quick and violent, it is much
better to begin with the Trot, which is a quick Action, than with the
Walk, which is slow and calm, however raised and supported its Action
may be.&mdash;Two things are requisite to form the Gallop, <i>viz.</i> it ought
to be <i>just</i>, and it ought to be <i>even</i> or <i>equal</i>.&mdash;I call that Gallop
<i>just</i>, in which the Horse leads with the Right-leg before, and I call
that the Right-leg which is foremost, and which the Horse puts out
beyond the other. For Instance&mdash;A Horse gallops and supports himself in
his Gallop, upon the outward Fore-foot, the Right Fore-foot clears the
Way, the Horse consequently gallops with the Right-foot, and the Gallop
is just, because he puts forward and leads with his Right-foot.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> Motion of the Right-foot is indispensably necessary, for
if the Horse were to put his Left Fore-foot first, his Gallop would
be <i>false</i>; so that it is to be understood, that whenever you put a
Horse to the Gallop, he should always go off with his Right fore-foot,
and keep it foremost,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span> or he can never be said to gallop <i>just</i> and
<i>true</i>.&mdash;I understand by an <i>even</i> or <i>equal</i> Gallop, that in which the
Hind-parts follow and accompany the Fore-parts; as for Example&mdash;If a
Horse gallops, or leads with his Right-leg before, the Hind Right-leg
ought to follow; for if the Left Hind-leg were to follow, the Horse
would then be disunited: The Justness then of the Gallop depends upon
the Action of the Fore-feet, as the Union or Evenness of it does on the
Hind-feet.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> general Rule which fixes the Justness of the Gallop, that
is to say, this Principle which obliges the Horse to lead with the
Right Fore-foot when he gallops, strict as it is, yet sometimes parts
with its Privileges in deference to the Laws of the Manage.&mdash;The Design
of this School is to make equally supple and active all the Limbs of
a Horse.&mdash;It is not requisite then that the Horse should lead always
with the same Leg, because it is absolutely necessary that he should
be equally ready and supple with both his Shoulders, in order to work
properly upon the different Airs.&mdash;It seems but reasonable that this
Rule should be observed likewise out of the Manage; and therefore it
has of late obtain'd that Hunting-horses should lead indifferently
with both Legs; because it has been found on Trial, that by strictly
adhering to the Rule of never suffering a Horse to gallop but with his
Right Fore-leg, he has been quite ruin'd and worn out on one Side, when
he was quite fresh and sound on the other.&mdash;Be that as it will, it is
not less certain, that in the Manage a Horse may gallop false, either
in going strait forward, or in going round, or upon a Circle; for
instance&mdash;He is going strait, and to the Right-hand, and sets off with
the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span> Left Fore-foot; he then is false, just as he would be, if in going
to the Left, he should lead with his Right Fore-foot.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Motions of a Horse, when disunited, are so disorder'd and
perplex'd, that he runs a risque of falling, because his Action then is
the Action of the Trot, and quite opposite to the Nature of the Gallop.
It is true, that for the Rider's Sake he had better be false.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">If</span> a Horse in full Gallop changes his Legs from one side
to the other alternately, this Action of the Amble in the Midst of
his Course, is so different from the Action of the Gallop, that it
occasions the Horse to go from the Trot to the Amble, and from the
Amble to the Trot.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> a Horse gallops strait forward, however short and
confin'd his Gallop is, his Hind-feet always go beyond his Fore feet,
even the Foot that leads, as well as the other.&mdash;To explain this.&mdash;If
the inner Fore-foot leads, the inner Hind-foot ought to follow, so
that the inner Feet, both that which leads, and that which follows,
are prest, the other two at liberty.&mdash;The Horse sets off, the outward
Fore-foot is on the Ground, and at liberty, this makes one <i>Time</i>;
immediately the inner Fore-foot which leads and is prest, marks a
second, here are two <i>Times</i>; then the outward Hind-foot which was on
the Ground, and at liberty, marks the third <i>Time</i>; lastly, the inner
Hind-foot which leads and is prest, comes to the Ground, and marks the
fourth; so that when a Horse goes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span> strait forward and gallops just, he
performs it in four distinct <i>Times</i>, <i>one</i>, <i>two</i>, <i>three</i>, <i>four</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is very difficult to feel exactly, and perceive these Times
of the Gallop; but yet by Observation and Practice it may be done.&mdash;The
Times of a Horse, who covers and embraces a good deal of Ground, are
much more easy to mark than his who covers but little.&mdash;The Action
of the one is quick and short, and that of the other long, slow, and
distinct; but whether the natural Motions and <i>Beats</i> of the Horse are
slow or quick, the Horseman absolutely ought to know them, in order
to humour and work conformably to them; for should he endeavour to
lengthen and prolong the Action of the one, in hopes of making him go
forward more readily, and to shorten and confine that of the other, in
order to put him more <i>together</i>; the Action of both would in this Case
not only be forced and disagreeable, but the Horses would resist and
defend themselves, because Art is intended only to assist and correct,
but not to change Nature.&mdash;In working your Horse upon Circles, it is
the outward Rein that you must use to guide and make him go forward;
for this purpose turn your Hand <i>in</i> from time to time, and aid with
your outward Leg.&mdash;If the Croupe should be turn'd too much out, you
must carry your Hand on the outward Side of your Horse's Neck; and
you will confine it, and keep it from quitting its Line.&mdash;I would be
understood of Circles of two Lines or Treads, where the Haunches are
to be attended to.&mdash;Before you put your Horse to this, he should be
gallop'd upon plain, or Circles of one Line only.&mdash;In this Lesson, in
order to supple your Horse,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span> make use of your inner Rein to pull his
Head towards the Center, and aid with the Leg of the same Side, to push
his Croupe out of the Volte; by this means you bend the Ribs of the
Horse.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Hind-feet certainly describe a much larger Circle than his
Fore-feet; indeed they make a second Line: but when a Horse is said
to gallop only upon a Circle of one Line or Tread, he always and of
necessity makes two; because, were the Hind-feet to make the same Line
as the Fore-feet, the Lesson would be of no use, and the Horse would
never be made supple; for he only becomes supple in proportion as the
Circle made with his Hind-feet is greater than that described by his
Fore-feet.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> your Horse is so far advanced, as to be able to gallop
lightly and readily upon this sort of Circle, begin then to make
frequent Stops with him.&mdash;To make them well in the Gallop, with his
Head in, and Croupe out, the Rider must use his outward Leg, to bring
<i>in</i> the outward Leg of the Horse; otherwise he would never be able to
stop upon his Haunches, because the outward Haunch is always out of the
Volte.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">To</span> make a Stop in a Gallop strait forwards, you should
carefully put your Horse <i>together</i>, without altering or disturbing
the Apuy, and throw your Body back a little, in order to accompany
the Action, and to relieve the Horse's Shoulders.&mdash;You should seize
the time of making the Stop, keeping your Hand and Body quite still,
exactly when you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span> feel the Horse put his Fore-feet to the Ground, in
order that by raising them immediately, by the next Motion that he
would make, he may be upon his Haunches.&mdash;If on the contrary, you
were to begin to make the Stop, while the Shoulders of the Horse were
advanced, or in the Air, you would run the Risque of hardening his
Mouth, and must throw him upon his Shoulders, and even upon the Hand,
and occasion him to make some wrong Motions with his Head, being thus
surprized at the Time when his Shoulders and Feet are coming to the
Ground.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">There</span> are some Horses who retain themselves, and don't put out
their Strength sufficiently; these should be galloped briskly, and then
slowly again, remembring to gallop them sometimes fast, and sometimes
slow, as you judge necessary.&mdash;Let them go a little Way at full Speed,
make a half Stop, by putting back your Body, and bring them again to a
slow Gallop; by these means they will most certainly be compelled both
to obey the Hand and Heel.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the slow Gallop, as well as in the Trot, it is necessary
sometimes to close your Heels to the Horse's Sides, this is called
<i>pinching</i>; but you must pinch him in such a manner, as not to make
him abandon himself upon the Hand, and take care that he be upon his
Haunches, and not upon his Shoulders, and therefore whenever you pinch
him, keep him in the Hand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span><span class="smcap">To</span> put him well together, and make him bring his Hind-legs
under him, close your two Legs upon him, putting them very back; this
will oblige him to slide his Legs under him; at the same Instant,
raise your Hand a little to support him before, and yield it again
immediately. Support him and give him the Rein again from time to time,
till you find that he begins to play and bend his Haunches, and that he
gallops leaning and sitting down as it were upon them; press him with
the Calfs of the Legs, and you will make him quick and sensible to the
Touch.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">If</span> your Horse has too fine a Mouth, gallop him upon sloping
ground, this will oblige him to lean a little upon the Hand, the better
to put himself upon his Haunches; and the Fear that he will be under of
hurting his Bars, will prevent his resisting the Operation of the Bitt.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">If</span> Galloping upon a sloping Ground assures and fixes a Mouth
that is weak and fickle, make use of the same Ground in making your
Horse ascend it, in case he is heavy in the Hand; and his Apuy be too
strong, and it will lighten him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">There</span> are some Horsemen who mark each Motion of the Horse in
his Gallop, by moving their Bodies and Heads; they ought, however,
without Stiffness or Constraint to consent and yield to all his
Motions, yet with a Smoothness and Pliancy so as not to be perceived,
for all great or rude Motions always disturb the Horse.&mdash;To do this you
must advance or present your Breast, and stretch yourself firm in your
Stirrups; this is the only Way to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span> fix and unite yourself entirely to
the Animal who carries you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Property of the Gallop is, as may be gathered from all
that has been said of it, to give the Horse a good Apuy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> reality, in this Action he lifts at every time both his
Shoulders and Legs together, in such a manner, that in making this
Motion his Fore-part is without Support, till his Fore-feet come to the
Ground; so that the Rider, by supporting or bearing him gently in Hand,
as he comes down, can consequently give an Apuy to a Mouth that has
none.&mdash;&mdash;You must take care, that by retaining your Horse too much in
his Gallop, you don't make him become <i>ramingue</i>, and weaken the Mouth
that is light and unsteady; as the full or extended Gallop is capable
on the other Hand, to harden an Apuy which was strong and <i>full in the
Hand</i> before.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Gallop does not only assure and make steady a weak and
delicate Mouth, but it also supples a Horse, and makes him ready and
active in his Limbs.&mdash;It fixes the Memory and Attention of Horses
likewise, who from too much Heat and Impetuosity in their Temper, never
attend to the Aids of the Rider, nor the Times of their setting off;
it teaches those who retain themselves, to go forward, and to set off
ready and with Spirit; and lastly, it takes off all the superfluous
Vigour of such Horses as, from too much Gaiety, avail themselves
of their Strength and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span> Courage to resist their Riders.&mdash;Take care,
however, to proportion this Lesson to the Nature, the Strength, and
Inclination of the Animal; and remember, that a violent and precipitate
Gallop would hurt an impatient and hot Horse, as much as it would be
proper and useful to one who retains himself, and is jadish and lazy.</p>

<i>Of Passades.</i></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Passades are the truest Proofs a Horse can give of his
Goodness.&mdash;By his going off you judge of his Swiftness; by his Stop,
you discover the Goodness or Imperfection of his Mouth; and by the
Readiness with which he turns, you are enabled to decide upon his
Address and Grace; in short, by making him go off a second time you
discover his Temper and Vigour.&mdash;When your Horse is light and active
before, is firm upon his Haunches, and has them supple and free, so as
to be able to accompany the Shoulders, is obedient and ready to both
Hands, and to the Stop, he is then fit to be work'd upon Passades.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<a name="image2" id="image2"></a>
<img src="images/image2.jpg" width="500" height="140" alt="Passade to the Right." />
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>Walk him along the Side of the Wall in a steady even Pace, supporting
and keeping him light in the Hand, in order to shew him the Length of
the Passade, and the Roundness of the <i>Volte</i> or <i>Demi-volte</i>, which he
is to make at the End of each Line.&mdash;Stop at the End, and when he has
finish'd the last Time of the Stop raise him, and let him make two or three Pesades. After this make
a Demivolte of two Lines in the Walk; and while he is turning, and the
Moment you have clos'd it, demand again of him two or three Pesades,
and then let him walk on in order to make as many to the other Hand.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<a name="image3" id="image3"></a>
<img src="images/image3.jpg" width="500" height="140" alt="Passade to the Left." />
</div>

<p>You must take care to confirm him well in this Lesson.&mdash;From the Walk
you will put him to the Trot upon a strait Line; from the Trot to a
slow Gallop, from that to a swifter; being thus led on by degrees, and
step by step, he will be able to furnish all sorts of Passades, and to
make the Demi-volte in any Air that you have taught him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">You</span> should never put your Horse to make a Volte or Demi-volte
at the time that he is disunited, pulls, or is heavy in the Hand, or is
upon his Shoulders; on the contrary, you should stop him at once, and
make him go backward till you perceive that he is regulated and united
upon his Haunches, light <i>before</i>, and has taken a good and just Apuy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
<span class="smcap">A perfect</span> Passade is made in this Manner.&mdash;Your Horse standing
strait and true upon all his Feet, you go off with him at once, you
stop him upon his Haunches; and in the same <i>Time</i> or <i>Cadence</i> in
which he made his Stop, being exactly obedient to the Hand and Heel, he
ought to make the Demi-volte, balancing himself upon his Haunches, and
so waiting till you give him the Aid to set off again. It is requisite
then that the least Motion or Hint of the Rider should be an absolute
Command to the Horse.&mdash;If you would have him go off at full Speed,
yield your Hand, close the Calves of your Legs upon him; if he don't
answer to this Aid, give him the Spurs, but you must give them so as
not to remove them from the Place where they were, and without opening
or advancing your Legs before you strike.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> high Passades are those which a Horse makes, when being
at the End of his Line, he makes his Demi-volte in any Air he has
been taught, either in the <i>Mezair</i> or in <i>Curvets</i>, which is very
beautiful.&mdash;Therefore in high Passades let your Horse go off at full
Speed; let your Stop be follow'd by three Curvets; let the Demi-volte
consist of the same Number, and demand of him three more before he sets
off again.&mdash;It is usual to make nine Curvets when you work a Horse
alone and by himself.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> furious or violent Passades, are when a Horse gallops
at his utmost Speed strait forward, and makes his half Stop, bending
and playing his Haunches two or three times, before he begins his
Demi-volte, which is made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span> upon one Line, in three Times; for at the
third Time he should finish the Demi-volte, and be strait upon the Line
of the Passade, in order to go off again and continue it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> sort of Passades was heretofore used in private Combats,
and although it may appear that the Time that is employed in making the
half Stop is lost, and only hinders you from gaining the Croupe of the
Enemy; yet the half Stop is indispensably necessary, for unless a Horse
is balanced upon his Haunches, and they bend and play under him, he
could never make his Demi-volte, without being in danger of Falling.</p>

<i>Of Pesades.</i></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span><span class="smcap">The</span> Pesade takes its Name from the Motion of the Horse, which,
in this Action, leans and lays all the Weight of his Body upon his
Haunches.&mdash;To be perfect, the Hind-feet which support the whole ought
to be fix'd and immoveable, and the Fore-part of the Horse more or less
rais'd, according as the Creature will allow, but the Fore-legs, from
the Knee to the Feet, must always be extremely bent and brought under
him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Property of the Pesade is to dispose and prepare a Horse
for all sorts of Manages; for it is the Foundation of all the Airs:
Great Caution, however, must be had not to teach your Horse to rise up
or stand upon his Haunches, which is making a <i>Pesade</i>, if he is not
quite exact and obedient to the Hand and Heel; for in this Case you
would throw him into great Disorder, spoil his Mouth, and falsify the
Apuy, would teach him to make <i>Points</i>, as they are called, and even
make him become <i>restive</i>; inasmuch as the generality of Horses only
rise up to resist their Rider, and because they will neither go forward
nor turn.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Your</span> Horse then being so far advanced as to be fit to be tried
and exercised in the Pesade, work him upon the Walk, the Trot, and
Gallop; stop him in the Hand, keep him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span> firm and moderately <i>together</i>;
aid with the Tongue, the Switch, and your Legs; the Moment you perceive
he comprehends what it is you would have him to do, though never so
little, encourage and caress him.&mdash;If in the Beginning of this Lesson
you were to use Force or Rigour, he would consider the Strictness of
your Hand, and the Aids of the Legs, as a Punishment, and it would
discourage him. It is therefore proper to work gently and by degrees;
whenever then he makes an Attempt to rise, caress him; make him go
forwards, try to make him rise a second time, either more or less, and
use him by degrees to rise higher and higher; you will find that he
will soon be able to make his Pesades perfect, and to make four, or
even more, with Ease and Readiness; sluggish and heavy Horses require
in the Beginning stronger and sharper Aids.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">There</span> are other Horses who are apt to rise of themselves,
without being requir'd to do so; drive them forward in order to prevent
them.&mdash;Some in making the Pesade, don't bend and gather up their
Fore-legs, but stretch them out, paw, and cross them one over the
other in the Air, resembling the Action of a Person's Hands who plays
upon the Spinnet; to these Horses you mush apply the Switch, striking
them briskly upon the Shoulders or Knees.&mdash;There are others, who in
the Instant that you endeavour to make them rise, availing themselves
of the Power which they have from being put <i>together</i>, in order to
perform this Action, throw themselves forward in hopes of freeing
themselves from all Subjection; the only Way to correct such Vices,
is to make the Horse go backward the same Length<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span> of Ground, that he
forced and broke through.&mdash;There is another kind of Horses, who to
avoid being <i>put together</i> in order to make a Pesade, as well as to
resist the Rider, will fling their Croupe <i>in</i> and <i>out</i>, sometimes to
one side, sometimes to the other; in this Case, if you perceive that
your Horse is apt to fling his Croupe more to the Left than to the
Right, you must put him to the Wall, the Wall being on the Left-hand,
and there support and confine him with your Right-leg, and even <i>pinch</i>
him if there should be occasion; taking care to carry your Hand to the
Right, but imperceptibly, and no more than what will just serve to
shorten the left Rein.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">If</span> he throws himself to the Right, you must put him so as to
have the Wall on the Right; you must support and pinch him with your
Left-leg, and shorten your Right-rein by carrying your Hand to the
Left.&mdash;I must however repeat it over and over, that in a Lesson of this
kind, in which a Horse may find out Methods and Inventions to resist
and defend himself; I say, in giving such Lessons, the Rider ought to
be Master of the surest Judgment and most consummate Prudence.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Moreover</span>, you should take care not to fall into the Mistake of
those who imagine that the higher a Horse rises, the more he is upon
his Haunches.&mdash;In the Pesade, the Croupe is pushed back, and the Horse
bends his Haunches; but if he rises too high, he no longer sits upon
his Haunches, for from that Moment he becomes stiff, and stands strait<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
upon his Hocks; and instead of throwing his Croupe back, he draws it
towards him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Those</span> Sort of Pesades, in which the Horse rises too high, and
stiffens his Hocks, are call'd <i>Goat-Pesades</i>, as they resemble the
Action of that Animal.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Aids that are to be given in Pesades are derived from
those used to make a Horse go backward.&mdash;Place your Hand as if you
intended to make your Horse go backward, but close your Legs at the
same time, and he will rise.&mdash;For this reason nothing is more absurd
than the Method which some Horsemen teach their Scholars, who oblige
them, in order to make their Horses rise, to use only their Switch;
they must certainly not know that the Hand confining the Fore-part,
and the Rider's Legs driving the Hinder-parts forward, the Horse is
compell'd, whether he will or no, to raise his Shoulders from the
Ground, and to throw all the Weight of his Body upon his Haunches.</p>

<i>Of the Mezair.</i></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span><span class="smcap">The</span> Gallop is the Foundation of the <i>Terre-a-Terre</i>; for in
these two Motions the Principle of the Action is the same, since the
<i>Terre-a-Terre</i> is only a shorten'd Gallop, with the Croupe <i>in</i>, and
the Haunches following in a close and quick Time.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Mezair is higher than the Action of <i>Terre-a-Terre</i>,
and lower than that of <i>Curvets</i>; we may therefore conclude, that
the <i>Terre-a-Terre</i>, is the Foundation of the Mezair, as well as of
<i>Curvets</i>.&mdash;In the <i>Terre-a-Terre</i>, the Horse should be more <i>together</i>
than in the Gallop, that he may mark his <i>Time</i> or <i>Cadence</i> more
distinctly; although in a true <i>Terre-a-Terre</i>, there are no Times to
be mark'd, for it is rather a gliding of the Haunches, which comes from
the natural Springs in the Limbs of the Horse.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">I have</span> said, that the <i>Terre-a-Terre</i> is the Foundation of the
<i>Mezair</i>; in effect, the higher you raise the Fore-parts of the Horse,
the slower and more distinct his Action will be, and by making him beat
and mark the Time with his Hind-feet, instead of gliding them along as
in the <i>Terre-a-Terre</i>, you put him to the <i>Mezair</i>, or <i>Half-curvets</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span><span class="smcap">When</span> a Horse works <i>Terre-a-Terre</i>, he always ought, the same
as in the <i>Gallop</i>, to lead with the Legs that are within the Volte,
his two Fore-feet being in the Air, and the Moment that they are coming
down, his two Hind-feet following.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Action of the Gallop is always one, two, three, and four;
the <i>Terre-a-Terre</i> consists only of two Lines, one, two.&mdash;The Action
is like that of <i>Curvets</i>, except that it is more under the Horse; that
is, he bends his Haunches more, and moves them quicker and closer than
in Curvets.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">To</span> work a Horse <i>Terre-a-Terre</i> upon large Circles, take
care to keep your Body strait, steady and true in the Saddle, without
leaning to one side or the other.&mdash;Lean upon the outward Stirrup, and
keep your outward Leg nearer the Side of the Horse than the other Leg,
taking care to do it so as not to let it be perceived.&mdash;If you go to
the Right, keep your Bridle-hand a little on the Outside of the Horse's
Neck, turning your little finger up, without turning your Nails at the
same time; although if need be you must turn them, in order to make the
inner Rein work which passes over the Little-finger.&mdash;Keep your Arms
and Elbows to your Hips, by this means you will assure and confine your
Hands, which ought to accompany, and, if I may so say, run along the
Line of the Circle with the Horse.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the <i>Mezair</i>, use the same Aids as in working upon
<i>Curvets</i>.&mdash;Give the Aids of the Legs with Delicacy, and no stronger
than is just necessary to carry your Horse forward.&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>Remember when
you close your Legs to make him go forward, to press with the Outward
in such a degree as to keep your Horse confin'd; and to assist the
other in driving him forward; it is not necessary to lay so much Stress
on the inner Leg, because that serves only to guide the Horse, and make
him cover and embrace the Ground that lays before him.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAP_XVIII" id="CHAP_XVIII"></a>CHAP. XVIII.<br />
<i>Of Curvets.</i></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Of</span> all the high Airs, Curvets are the least violent, and
consequently the most easy to the Horse, inasmuch as they require
nothing of the Horse but what he has done before. In reality, to make
him stop readily and justly, he has been taught to take a good and
true Apuy; in order to make him rise, he has been put <i>together</i>, and
supported firm upon his Haunches; to make him advance, to make him
go backward, and to make him stop, he has been made acquainted with
the Aids of the Heels and Hands; so that in order to execute Curvets,
nothing remains for him to do, but to learn and comprehend the Measure
and Time of the Air.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Curvets</span> are derived and drawn out of the Pesades.&mdash;We have
already said that Pesades ought to be made slowly, very high before,
and accompanied a little by the Haunches. Curvets<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span> are lower before,
the Horse must advance, his Haunches must follow closer, and <i>beat</i> or
mark a quicker <i>Time</i>; the Haunches must be bent, his Hocks be firm,
his two Hind-feet advance equally at every Time, and their Action must
be short quick, just, and in exact Measure and Proportion.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> Action, when suited to the Strength and Disposition of
the Horse, is not only beautiful in itself, but even necessary to fix
and place his Head; because this Air is, or ought to be founded, upon
the true <i>Apuy</i> of his Mouth. It likewise lightens the Fore-part; for
as it can't be perform'd unless the Horse collects his Strength upon
his Haunches, it must of consequence take the Weight off from the
Shoulders.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is well known, that in working upon every Air, the
Strength, the Vigour, and the Disposition of the Horse should be
consider'd; the Importance of this Attention to these Qualities is
sufficiently acknowledged; and it is granted and allowed, that Art
serves, and can serve, to no other end than to improve and make Nature
perfect.&mdash;Now it will be easy to discover to what Air a Horse should
be destin'd, and to what he is most dispos'd and capable of executing,
by seeing his Actions, and by the greater or less Degree of Pains
which will be requisite to supple him. When you design a Horse for the
<i>Curvets</i>, take care to chuse one, which, besides having the necessary
Disposition to that Manage, will have likewise Patience enough in his
Temper to perform them well.&mdash;A natural Disposition alone will not
suffice; there are Horses who will present themselves to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span> them, but
being by Nature impatient of all Restraint, from the Moment that they
feel any Pain or Difficulty in furnishing what you ask of them, they
will disobey and deceive you in the very Instant that you thought them
gain'd.&mdash;It requires much Skill to know how to begin with such Horses,
and to confirm them in their Business.&mdash;Take it for a certain Truth,
that you will never succeed, if your Horse is not perfectly obedient to
the Hand and Heel; if he is not supple, and able to work upon one Line
or Path, with Freedom and Ease; and if he is not likewise very well
seated upon his Haunches in his <i>Terre-a-Terre</i>, which he ought to be
able to execute perfectly well.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Curvets</span> are improper, and never succeed with Horses which have
bad Feet, or any Weakness or Complaint in their Hocks, whatever Powers
and Qualifications they may otherwise have.&mdash;They are likewise apt
to encourage a Horse that is <i>ramingue</i> in his Vice, and are capable
of teaching one which is not so by Nature, to become <i>ramingue</i>,
if he is not adjusted and brought to this Air with great Prudence.
Indeed, Impatience and Fretfulness often make a Horse desperate when
put to this Manage; and not being able to endure the Correction, nor
comprehend the Aids, he betakes himself to all sorts of Defences, as
well as that being confounded through Fear, he is bewilder'd, and
becomes abject and jadish.&mdash;It is almost impossible to say which of
these Imperfections are the most difficult to be cured.&mdash;Before you
put a Horse to make <i>Curvets</i>, he ought to work <i>Terre-a-Terre</i>; and
if he can do this, he ought to be able to change Hands upon <i>one</i> and
<i>two Lines</i>, to go off readily, and to make a good Stop. After<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span> this
he should be able to make Pesades easily, and so high before as to be
held and supported in the Hand, and always make them upon a strait Line
at first, and not on a Circle.&mdash;After this ask of him two or three
<i>Curvets</i>; let him go then two or three Steps, then make two or three
<i>Curvets</i>; and so alternately.&mdash;If you find that your Horse is well
in the Hand, and that he advances regularly, is patient, and don't
break his Line, but keeps even upon it, he will dress very easily,
and soon; if he presses forward too much, make him curvet in the same
Place, and make him often go backward.&mdash;After he has thus made two or
three, demand then more of him, afterwards make him go backward, and so
successively.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">One</span> sees but few Horses which in making Curvets, plant
themselves well upon their Haunches and Hocks, at least that are
not apt to hang back, and who beat and mark equally and smartly the
Measure of the Air, and keep their Heads true and steady; for this
Reason the first Lessons should be slow and gentle, making your Horse
rise very high before, because the longer time the Horse is in the
Air, the easier it will be to him to adjust himself upon his Haunches,
and to assure his Head, and bend or <i>gather up</i> his Fore-legs; on the
contrary, if he don't rise high before, he only beats and throws about
the Dust, and shuffles his Legs, and can never assemble the different
Parts of his Body and be united, as he ought to be in this Manage.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> a Horse in his first Curvets makes of himself his Beats,
or Times, diligent and quick, it is to be fear'd that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span> this is only
owing to Fire and Impatience; in this Case there will be reason to
suspect, that he has not Strength sufficient for this Manage, that
he will soon do nothing but shuffle and throw about his Legs without
rising as he ought, or else that he will become <i>entier</i>; but if
he rises freely and sufficiently high, without being in a hurry,
or stiffening himself, and bends his Hocks, it will then be very
easy to shorten, reduce, and adjust the Measure of his Air, and to
make it perfect in proportion to his Resolution, his Strength, and
Activity.&mdash;If when you are going to raise him, he rises suddenly of
himself, consider whether this hasty Action be not a Proof likewise of
what I have just now told you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Beauty and Perfection of the fine Airs when neatly
executed, and their Time just and true, don't consist so much in the
Diligence and Quickness with which the Horse brings his Hind-feet to
the Ground and makes his <i>Beats</i>; for if that were the Proof, the Horse
would not have sufficient Time to raise his Fore-part, and to gather
his Fore-legs under him; but the true Measure, and the Harmony of his
<i>Time</i>, is when the Hind-feet follow smoothly, and answer immediately
to the Fore-feet, and that these rise again in the Instant that the
others touch the Ground.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">To</span> teach a Horse to <i>beat</i> his <i>Curvets</i> neatly, and in an
equal <i>Time</i> and <i>Measure</i>, take care to keep him in a good and just
<i>Apuy</i>; keep yourself strait and well stretch'd down in the Saddle, but
without any Stiffness, preserving always a certain Ease and Freedom,
which is the Characteristic of an Horseman: let your Hand be about
three Fingers Breadth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span> above the Pommel of the Saddle, and a little
forward or advanced, keeping your Nails up, and be diligent and ready
to raise your Horse; when you do this, put your Body a little forward,
but so as not to let it be perceived: above all put no Stress in your
Legs, but let them be easy and loose, they will catch the <i>Time</i>
of themselves better than you can give it. I am now speaking of an
high-drest and perfect Horse, who works with the greatest Exactness;
for if he was to break the Line, to throw himself from one Side to the
other, refuse to advance, or not to lift his Legs, you would then be
obliged to give the Aids in proportion to his Understanding and Feeling.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is not requisite that a Horse should be absolutely perfect
in Curvets strait forward, before you put him to make them upon
<i>Voltes</i>. By being accustom'd to make them strait forward, when he is
put to do them differently, he would feel a fresh Constraint; in this
Case he might break and perplex his Air in the Action of turning, he
would falsify the <i>Volte</i>, and perhaps fall into many Disorders; it is
therefore right, as soon as he is grounded a little in Curvets strait
forwards, to begin to teach him the <i>Time</i> and the Proportions of the
<i>Volte</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Walk</span> him then upon a <i>Volte</i> that is sufficiently large, and
exactly round, taking care that he walks neither too slow nor too fast,
and making him bring <i>in</i> his Head to the <i>Volte</i>, so that he may
acquire a Habit of looking always into the <i>Volte</i>, without letting his
Hind-feet however go off the Line of his Fore-feet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span><span class="smcap">Having</span> thus taught him in the Walk to both Hands the Space or
Ground of the <i>Volte</i>, let him make three <i>Pesades</i>, then three more,
and let him make them with Patience and lightly, but without stopping.
Trot him then upon the <i>Volte</i>, stop him without letting him rise,
caress him, and begin with him again to the other Hand, and repeat
the same.&mdash;When he begins to understand this Lesson, let him make two
<i>Pesades</i> together, then let him walk as before; observe these Rules
and this Method, without hurrying or pressing him; increase by degrees
by the Number of <i>Pesades</i>, and let him walk less as he begins to work
with more Ease; by these means he will soon be brought to furnish an
entire <i>Volte</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> your Horse is so far advanced as to work upon the large
<i>Voltes</i> in this slow Manner, begin then by degrees to contract his
Compass of Ground, and the Measure of the Pesades, till the <i>Volte</i> and
the <i>Air</i> are reduced to their exact Proportion; preventing him by Aids
and Correction from putting his Croupe <i>out</i>, or bringing it too much
<i>within</i> the <i>Volte</i>, and taking care that he makes no wrong or aukward
Action with his Head.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is impossible that a Horse should furnish his Air high,
without shortening and contracting his Body a good deal beyond his
natural Posture or Make; because the Action of itself is contracted and
supported on the Haunches, in such a manner that the Hind-feet must of
necessity advance, and widen the Line which they made in the Walk; or
else the Fore-feet must go back, and keep up the Line and Roundness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
of the <i>Volte</i>; or else that the Hind or Fore-feet keeping an equal
Proportion, and answering each to each shorten it equally.&mdash;These
different Effects are very essential and worth remarking.&mdash;The first
Aid to be given should be with the Legs, in order to make the Horse's
Fore-feet keep thro' this high Air the Line of the <i>Volte</i>, which he
had mark'd out before in the Walk. If he goes large, or quits the Line,
or abandons himself upon his Shoulders, or upon the Hand, the first Aid
then should come from the Hand; this by confining will operate so as
to raise him, and the Hind-feet will come upon the Line describ'd in
the Passage; lastly, if the Horse is obedient, the Rider will be able
to unite him both behind and before, by the usual Aids of the Hand and
Heel acting together.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> a Horse walks or trots upon the <i>Volte</i>, he is supported
in his Action by one of his Fore and one of his Hind-feet, which are
both upon the Ground together, while the other two are in the Air;
so that according to this Method the Line of the Fore-feet, and that
of the hind, are made at the same time; but when he raises his Air
and advances upon the <i>Volte</i>, all his Actions are changed; for then
the two Fore-feet are lifted up the first, and while they are coming
down, he lifts the two Hind-feet from the Ground together, to finish
and continue the <i>Beats</i> or <i>Time</i> of his Air. The Fore-feet being
more advanced than the hind, must necessarily come down first, and
consequently the Horse can never be upon strait Lines crossing each
other, as he is when he walks or trots upon the <i>Volte</i>. Moreover,
in a high Air the Horse does not only shorten and contract his whole
Action;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span> but the better to strengthen and assist the Attitude in
which he supports and goes through his Air, he opens and widens his
Hind-feet, keeping them at least twice the Distance one from the other,
that he did when he only walk'd or trotted upon the <i>Volte</i>, and by
consequence describes different Lines.&mdash;There are three Actions, and
three Motions, still to be consider'd in making <i>Curvets</i>. These are,
to raise him, to support him while he is in the Air, and to make him go
forwards.&mdash;To raise him, is to lift him up as it were by the Action of
the Hand, and put him upon an high Air; to support, is to hinder him
from bringing his Fore-part too soon to the Ground; and carrying him
forward, is to raise, support, and go forward at the same time, while
the Horse is off the Ground.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">To</span> make a Horse go in <i>Curvets</i> sideways, aid only with the
Hand, keeping his Head to the Wall. For instance, to the Right, aid
him chiefly with the outward Rein; that is to say, turn your Hand to
the Right, for then the Left-rein, which is the outward Rein, will be
shorten'd and operate upon the Shoulders so as to work them.&mdash;If they
go too much, use your inner Rein, carrying your Hand <i>out</i>, and in such
a manner that the Shoulders may go before the Croupe.&mdash;Let him make
three <i>Curvets</i> sideways, passage him afterwards, always sideways; then
let him make the same Number of <i>Curvets</i> sideways, and obliquely,
again, and begin by little and little to diminish his <i>Passage</i>, and
augment the <i>Curvets</i>, till he is able to furnish without Intervals
an entire <i>Volte</i> of two Lines. The same Method must be followed in
working to the Left, as has been prescribed for the Right.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span> <i>Curvets</i>
made backward are more fatiguing, and more apt to make a Horse rebel,
than <i>Curvets</i> strait forward upon the <i>Voltes</i>, <i>Demi-voltes</i>, or
<i>sideways</i>.&mdash;To teach him to make them backwards, you must make him
go backward; afterwards put him to make three or four <i>Curvets</i> in
the same Place, that is, without advancing.&mdash;Then make him go forward
again, let him make the same Number again; and so successively till he
makes them readily and without Assistance.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">By</span> Habit he will expect to be made to go backward immediately
after the last <i>Curvet</i>: now, the Moment he has made one in the same
Place, when he is making the second, seize the Moment just as he is
coming down, and pull him back, marking a <i>Time</i> with your Hand, just
as you would pull to make a Horse go backward which resisted the Hand;
and this <i>Time</i> of the Hand being made, ease it immediately. In this
Manner continue the <i>Curvets</i>, pulling more or less, according as he
obeys or resists; observing to lessen the Times of pulling him back,
and to increase the Number of the <i>Curvets</i> backwards.&mdash;If he drags his
Haunches, that is, if the Hind-feet don't go together, but one after
the other, pinch him with both Spurs; but you must put them very back,
applying them with great Delicacy, and taking care that he be in the
Hand when he comes down.&mdash;If with all this he continues <i>disunited</i>,
aid on the Croupe with the Switch, turning the bigger End of it in your
Hand; and this will make him work and keep his <i>Time</i> or <i>Beats</i> very
exactly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span><span class="smcap">To</span> go backwards in <i>Curvets</i>, aid with the outward Rein, you
will confine the Fore-part, and widen the Hind-legs, which ought to be
at liberty, because it is with them that he leads. They are follow'd by
the Fore-parts, which should keep the same Ground or Tract.&mdash;You must
keep your Hand low, that the Horse may not go too high.&mdash;Let your Body
be a little forward to give the greater Liberty to the Hind-legs, which
are those that lead; and don't aid with your Legs, unless he drags his
Haunches.&mdash;If the Horse does not <i>unite</i> of his own accord, you must
catch the <i>Time</i> with your Bridle-hand, as the Horse is coming to the
Ground; in that Instant, put your Hand to your Body, and so pull him
back.&mdash;Let us now see how you should be placed in the Saddle, to make
<i>Curvets</i> upon the <i>Voltes</i>.&mdash;Let only your outward Hip and outward
Haunch be a little advanc'd; and remember to loosen always, and relax
the Inside of your Knees, or your Legs from the Knees. When you intend
to change to the Left, let your Hand accompany and correspond with your
Right-leg, which is to operate; when you would change to the Right, let
it answer to your Left-leg: Having given this Aid, replace yourself,
stretch yourself down in your Saddle, take away your Legs, one or the
other, forbear to aid, and let the Balance of your Body be somewhat on
the Inside.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Understanding</span> thus, and being Master of the Aids for working
a Horse in <i>Curvets</i> strait forwards, backwards, sideways, to the
Right and Left, you will be able easily to teach your Horse to make a
Cross, or even dance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span> the Saraband in this Air; but this requires as
much Justness and Activity in the Horse, as Exactness and Delicacy in
the Rider to be able to give the Aids, and very few Horses are able to
execute all these Lessons which I have described: the utmost Efforts of
Art, and the greatest Suppleness that a Horse can acquire, will be in
vain, and unsuccessful, if he is not by Nature inclin'd and disposed to
the Manage. That sort of Exercise which hits the Temper, and best suits
the Strength of a Horse, will appear graceful, and preserve his Health;
while that which is opposite to his Temper and Genius will dishearten
him, make him timid and abject, and plunge him into numberless Ails and
Vices.</p>

<i>Of Croupades and Balotades.</i></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span><span class="smcap">The</span> <i>Croupade</i> is a Leap, in which the Horse draws up his
Hinder-legs as if he meant to shorten and truss them up under his Belly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> <i>Balotade</i> is likewise a Leap, in which the Horse seems
as if he intended to kick out, but without doing it; he only offers or
makes a half Kick, shewing only the Shoes of his Hind-feet.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Horses that are destin'd to these Airs ought to have a
light and steady Mouth, and an active and lively Disposition, with
clean and nervous Strength; for all the Art and Knowledge of the
Horseman can never confer these Qualities, which are essentially
necessary to the Perfection of this Manage.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> <i>Croupades</i> and <i>Balotades</i> are different from <i>Curvets</i>,
inasmuch as that they are much higher behind, and consequently their
Time and Measure not so quick and close, but slower and more extended.
Therefore the Rider should keep his Horse's Croupe ready and in awe, by
striking it from time to time with the Switch, supporting him not quite
so high before,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span> and observing to aid with his Legs slower, and not so
forward, as in the <i>Curvets</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">As</span> the Perfection of <i>Curvets</i>, both upon the <i>Voltes</i> and
strait forwards, is owing to the Ease and Justness of the Pesades, the
Goodness of <i>Croupades</i> and <i>Balotades</i> depends likewise upon the same
Rules. Your Horse being made light before by the means of <i>Pesades</i> and
<i>Curvets</i>, begin by making him rise, as well before as behind, less
however in the first Lessons than afterwards; for you will never bring
him to the true Pitch, were you to exhaust all his Strength at once,
since while he is prest and compell'd to put forth all his Strength, he
will never be able to catch and mark the <i>Time</i>, the Cadence, and the
just <i>Beats</i> of his Air, both behind and before.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">I have</span> already said, that the <i>Croupades</i> and the <i>Balotades</i>
are higher than the Curvets, they nevertheless partake of it; for
though a Horse that makes <i>Balotades</i>, makes the Measure of each Time
as high behind as before, yet he follows the <i>Beat</i> of his Fore-feet
with that of his Hind-feet, the same as in <i>Curvets</i>; for this Reason,
a Horse that is intended for the <i>Croupades</i> and <i>Balotades</i>, ought
to be more active, light, and strong than one that is to be drest for
<i>Curvets</i>, as he should have less Strength than one who is put to make
Caprioles strait forwards, or on Voltes of one Line, and to repeat them
in the same Place.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">To</span> manage the Strength and Vigour of the Horse you intend
to work upon the <i>Voltes</i> in <i>Croupades</i> and <i>Balotades</i>, let<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span> the
Line of the <i>Volte</i> be larger than for <i>Curvets</i>, and let the Action
of the Shoulders not be quite so high; thus you will not only check
and confine his Activity and Lightness; but by raising his Shoulders
in a less Degree, you will give Liberty to his Croupe, and he will
be enabled by this Method to furnish his Airs all together, that is
<i>before</i> and <i>behind</i>, better, and with more Ease; there is still
another Reason for this, for when the Shoulders come to the Ground from
too great a Height, the Shock alarms and disorders the Mouth; and then
the Horse losing the Steadiness of his <i>Apuy</i>, he never will raise his
Croupe so high as he ought, to make perfect <i>Balotades</i>.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAP_XX" id="CHAP_XX"></a>CHAP. XX.<br />
<i>Of Caprioles.</i></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span><span class="smcap">There</span> is no such Thing as an universal Horse; that is, as a
Horse who works equally well upon all Airs, the <i>Terre-a-Terre</i>, the
<i>Curvets</i>, <i>Mezair</i>, <i>Croupades</i>, <i>Balotades</i>, and <i>Caprioles</i>, each
Horse having a particular Disposition, which inclines to some certain
Air which suits him best. A Horse that is naturally inclin'd to the
high Airs, ought to be managed with great Gentleness and Patience;
inasmuch as he will be in greater Danger of being disgusted and
spoil'd, as his Disposition to the high Airs is owing generally to the
Gaiety and Sprightliness of his Temper; and as such Tempers are usually
averse to Subjection, Constraint and Correction, Rigour and Severity
would make him become timid and angry, and then he could not attend
to and catch the <i>Time</i>, <i>Order</i>, and <i>Measure</i> of the high Airs;
therefore if you would reduce him to the Justness of the high Airs, and
teach him their Harmony and Measure, you must not expect to succeed by
any other ways than by giving your Instructions with great Patience and
Judgment, and soon or late he will be gain'd.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Feet are the Foundations upon which all the high Airs, if
I may use the Word, are built. They ought then to be attended to very
strictly; for if your Horse has any Pain, Weakness, or other Defect in
his Feet, he will be so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span> much the more improper to leap, as the Pain
which he must feel when he comes to the Ground, would shoot quite to
his Brain.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">As</span> a Proof of this, when a Horse whose Feet are bad or tender
trots upon the Stones, or hard Ground, you will see him shut his Eyes,
drop his Head at each Step, and shake his Tail from very Pain.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> <i>Capriole</i> is the most violent of the high Airs. To make
it perfect, the Horse is to raise his Fore-parts and his Hinder to
an equal Height; and when he strikes out behind, his Croupe should
be upon a Level with his Withers. In rising and in coming down his
Head and Mouth should be quite steady and firm, and he should present
his Forehead quite strait.&mdash;When he rises, his Fore-legs should be
bent under him a good deal, and equally. When he strikes out with his
Hind-legs, he ought to do it nervously, and with all his Force; and
his two Feet should be even, of an equal Height, and their Action the
same when he strikes out: lastly, the Horse should at every Leap fall
a Foot and a half, or the Space of two Feet distance from the Spot
from which he rose.&mdash;I don't assert, that in order to make <i>Caprioles</i>
a Horse must necessarily pass through <i>Curvets</i> and <i>Balotades</i>; for
there are Horses who are naturally more light and active in their Loins
than strong, and who are brought to leap with more Difficulty, than to
the other Airs in which their Strength must be much more united, and
their Disposition attended to; but yet it is certain, that if the Horse
is brought to rise by Degrees, and is work'd in the intermediate Airs,
before he undertakes the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span> <i>Caprioles</i>, he will not weaken and strain
himself so much, and will be sooner confirm'd in his Lesson than one
who begins at once with the <i>Caprioles</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Having</span> thus explain'd to Demonstration the Motions of a
Horse, when he makes a perfect <i>Capriole</i>, you may hence gather
that they have an Effect directly opposite to that of <i>Curvets</i> and
<i>Pesades</i>.&mdash;These two Airs are proper to assure the Head of the Horse,
and to make it light, and this by so much the more as the principal
Action depends upon the Haunches, and a moderate <i>Apuy</i> of the Mouth;
but <i>Caprioles</i> are apt to give too great an <i>Apuy</i>, because the Horse
when he makes the strongest Action of his Air, that is, when he strikes
out as he is coming to the Ground, is entirely supported by the Hand;
therefore before he is put to leap, he ought to have a perfect Apuy,
and his Shoulders should at least be suppled and lighten'd by having
made <i>Pesades</i>; and he should be without Fear, Anger, or any kind of
Uneasiness, because, as I have already said, by leaping he learns to
know his own Strength and Power; and he may put it to bad Purposes to
free himself from Obedience, and indulge his Caprice and Ill-humour.
Some Horses have a Disposition to this Air, and sufficient Strength
to go through it; yet have their Mouth so delicate, sensible, and
averse to the Hand, that you can't support them without hindering them
from advancing; hence it follows that their Action before is cold and
slow, and never sufficiently high, and they can't be carried forward
when they raise their Croupe and strike out; and it is impossible to
keep them firm as they come down. To remedy this, begin their Lesson
upon the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span> Trot, and press them in it so smartly as to make them
often go into the Gallop; observe a Medium however in order to save
their Strength and Vigour, that they may furnish as many Leaps as is
requisite to the Perfection of the Air. Do the same with a Horse that
has too much Strength, and who retains and avails himself it, so as
not to make his Leaps freely and readily; by this means you will abate
his superfluous Vigour, which serves only to <i>disunite</i> and make him
troublesome.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is usual to supple a Horse that is light in the Hand by
means of the Trot, before you teach him to leap: but a contrary Method
must be observed with those which are heavy and clumsey, or that
are heavy in the Hand. Gallop and trot them, and when they are made
obedient and drest to the <i>Caprioles</i>, their Apuy in leaping will grow
by degrees lighter and more temperate. The Exercise of the Trot and
Gallop will take away all Fear of the Aids and Corrections, and the Day
following they will present themselves more freely and willingly. With
respect to the Horse who pulls or wants to force the Hand, don't try to
correct him by making him go backward, because by working upon his Bars
too much with the Bit, you would make them become hard and insensible;
but compel him to make some <i>Caprioles</i> with his Face to the Wall, and
keep him up to it closer or further off, as you find him heavy, or
endeavouring to force the Hand; by these Methods you will constrain him
to shorten his Leaps, and give more Attention to his Business. If he
abandons himself, or bears too hard upon the Hand, hold him firm at the
End of his Leap; and in the Instant that his Feet are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span> coming to the
Ground, yield it immediately to him, and he will abandon himself much
less upon the Bit.&mdash;If he retains himself, and hangs back, easing your
Hand to him alone will not be sufficient; but to make him advance you
must push him up to his Bit, by aiding him briskly and in <i>Time</i> with
your Legs.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">To</span> dress a Horse to the Caprioles, the Pillars may be
employ'd, or they may be dispens'd with: let us explain the Rules we
should follow with respect to both these Methods.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is certain that the Pillars are of use in putting a Horse
to this Air.&mdash;Tie him to them, make him keep up to his Bit properly, or
what is call'd <i>fill up the Cords</i>, and endeavour by little and little
to make him rise before, taking care to make him bend his Knees, and
gather up his Legs as much as you possibly can. For this purpose use
your Switch briskly; for if you can teach him to bend his Legs well,
his Manage will be infinitely more beautiful; as well as that he will
be much lighter in the Hand.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Having</span> thus gain'd the Fore-part, put him in the Pillars
again, making the Cords somewhat shorter in order to make him raise
his Croupe from the Ground, and yerk out equally at the same time with
both his Hind-legs, which you must teach him to do, by attacking and
striking him upon the Croupe with the Switch or <i>Chambriere</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> he is so far advanced as to rise before, and lash out
behind, it will be proper to teach him to unite these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span> two Times, and
perform them together.&mdash;Let him then be mounted, and always in the
Pillars; let the Rider support him in the Hand, and try to make him
make one or two Leaps, without hanging upon the Cords of the Caveson,
in order that he may learn to take a just Apuy, and to feel it. As soon
as he begins to know and obey the Hand, he should be aided gently with
the Calves of the Legs, should be supported, and you should pinch him
delicately and finely with both Spurs. If he answers once or twice to
these Aids, without losing his Temper, or being angry, you will have
great Reason to expect that he will soon furnish his Leaps equally and
justly with respect to the Hand and Heel.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Having</span> brought him thus far between the Pillars, walk him
strait forward for a certain Space, and if he don't offer to rise of
himself, try to make him. If he himself takes the right Time, seize
the Moment, avail yourself of it, and make him make two or three
<i>Caprioles</i>, or one or two, according as you judge it necessary; by
letting him walk thus calmly and quietly, in a short time he will of
himself begin to make <i>Caprioles</i> strait forward; but in case he should
discover any Signs of Resistance to the Hand or Heel, or the other
Aids, immediately have recourse to the Caveson and Pillars.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> is in short the Method of adjusting and dressing a Horse
for <i>Caprioles</i> by the means of the Pillars.&mdash;A Method extremely
dangerous in itself, and capable of spoiling and making a Horse become
desperate and ungovernable, if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span> it is not practised by Persons of the
most consummate Skill and Experience.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Method which I prefer is indeed more difficult and painful
to the Horse, but more perfect and sure.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Horse having been well exercised in <i>Pesades</i>, walk him
strait forward, keeping him together, and supporting him so as to hold
and keep him in the Hand, but not to such a degree as to stop him
entirely. After this strike him gently with the End of the Switch upon
his Croupe and Buttocks, and continue to do it till he lifts up his
Croupe, and kicks.&mdash;You should then caress him, and let him walk some
Steps, and then attack him again, not minding to make him rise before,
nor hindering him from it, if he offers so to do. Remember to encourage
and coax him every time that he answers to the Aids, and obeys.&mdash;Being
thus acquainted with the Aid of the Switch, put him to make <i>Pesades</i>
of a moderate Height strait forward, and at the second or third, attack
him behind with your Switch to make him lash out. If he obeys, make him
rise before again in the Minute that his Hind-legs come to the Ground,
in order to make him furnish two or three more <i>Pesades</i>, to work his
Haunches. After this coax and caress him without letting him stir from
the Place, if his <i>Apuy</i> be firm and good; and in case it is hard,
make him go backward, or if it is light and just, letting him advance
quietly and slowly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">To</span> enable him to make his Leaps just, and to know the exact
Time of making them, you should no longer regard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span> what Number of
<i>Pesades</i> he makes before or after his Leap, but in the Moment that you
feel him ready and prepar'd, and whilst he is in the <i>Pesade</i>, aid him
briskly behind, letting him in the Beginning not rise so high before,
when you intend he should yerk out behind, as you would were he only
to make a <i>Pesade</i>, that so his Croupe may be more at liberty, and he
may yerk out with greater Ease; in proportion as his Croupe becomes
light and active, you may raise his Fore-parts higher and higher, and
support him while in the Air, till he makes his Leaps true and in just
Proportion.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> you have sufficiently practised these Lessons, you may
retrench by degrees the Number of the <i>Pesades</i> which separated and
divided the Leaps. You may demand now of him two Leaps together; from
these you may come, with Patience and Discretion, to three, from three
to four Leaps; and lastly, to as many as he can furnish in the same
Air, and with equal Strength. Remember always to make him finish upon
his Haunches, it is the only sure way to prevent all the Disorders a
Horse may be guilty of from Impatience and Fear.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">There</span> are some Horses who will leap very high, and with great
Agility strait forwards, which when put to leap upon the <i>Voltes</i>, lose
all their natural Grace and Beauty; the Reason is, that they fail for
Want of Strength, and are not equal to the Task, in which all their
Motions are forced and constrain'd.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span><span class="smcap">If</span> you find a Horse who has a good and firm <i>Apuy</i>, and who
has Strength sufficient to furnish this Air upon the <i>Voltes</i>; begin
with him by making him know the Space and Roundness of the <i>Volte</i> to
each Hand; let him walk round it in a slow and distinct Pace, keeping
his Croupe very much press'd and confin'd upon the Line of the <i>Volte</i>,
which ought to be much larger for this Air than for <i>Croupades</i> and
<i>Balotades</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> being done, make him rise, and let him make one or two
<i>Caprioles</i>, follow'd by as many <i>Pesades</i>; then walk on two or three
Steps upon the same Line; then raise him again, supporting him more and
more, and keeping him even on the Line of the <i>Volte</i>, so that it may
be exactly round, and confining his Croupe with your outward Leg.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">If</span> this Lesson be given with Judgment, your Horse will soon
make all the <i>Volte</i>, in the same Air; and to make him furnish a
second, as soon as he has closed and finish'd the first, raise him
again, and without letting him stop get from him as many as you can,
working him always upon this <i>Volte</i>, in which he walks and leaps
alternatively, till he closes and ends it with the same Vigour and
Resolution as he did the first.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Aid</span> always with the outward Rein, either upon the <i>Voltes</i>,
or when you leap strait forwards, you will narrow and confine the
Fore-parts, and enlarge the Hind-parts, by which means the Croupe will
not be press'd, but free and unconstrain'd.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span><span class="smcap">I will</span> enlarge no further upon his Chapter; for what regards
the making <i>Caprioles</i> upon the <i>Voltes</i>, you may look back to what has
been already said on the Subject of <i>Curvets</i>: remember that the surest
way to succeed, when you undertake to dress a Horse to <i>Caprioles</i>,
is to arm yourself with a Patience that nothing can subdue or shake;
and to prefer for this purpose such Horses as have a Disposition, are
active, light, and have a clean sinewy Strength, to such as are endowed
with greater Strength and Force; for these last never leap regularly,
and are fit for nothing but to break their Riders Backs, and make them
spit Blood, by their irregular, violent, and unexpected Motions.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAP_XXI" id="CHAP_XXI"></a>CHAP. XXI.<br />
<i>Of the Step and Leap.</i></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
<span class="smcap">The</span> Step and Leap is composed of three Airs; of the <i>Step</i>,
which is the Action of the <i>Terre-a-Terre</i>; the rising before, which is
a <i>Curvet</i>; and the Leap, which is a <i>Capriole</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> Manage is infinitely less painful to a Horse than that of
the <i>Capriole</i>; for when you dress a Horse to the <i>Capriole</i>, he will
of himself take this Air for his Ease and Relief; and in time those
Horses, which have been drest to the <i>Caprioles</i>, will execute only
<i>Balotades</i> and <i>Croupades</i>, unless particular Care is taken to make
them yerk out.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is this likewise, which, next to running a brisk Course,
enlivens and animates a Horse most.&mdash;To reduce a Horse to the Justness
of this Air, you must begin by emboldening and making him lose all fear
of Correction; teaching him to keep his Head steady, and in a proper
Place; lightening His Fore-parts, by putting him to make <i>Pesades</i>;
teaching him to know the Aids of the Switch, the same as in the Lesson
of the <i>Caprioles</i>; and by giving him a firm and good <i>Apuy</i>, <i>full in
the Hand</i>: though it is certain, that the <i>Step</i> contributes to give
him this <i>Apuy</i>, inasmuch as that it puts him in the Hand; besides that
it gives him Strength and Agility to leap, just as we ourselves leap
with a quicker<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span> Spring while running, than if we were to stand quite
still and leap; therefore most old Horses generally fall into this Air.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> your Horse is sufficiently knowing in these several
Particulars, teach him to rise, and support or hold him in the Air;
then let him make four <i>Pesades</i>, and afterwards let him walk four or
five Steps slow and equal; if he forces the Hand, or retains himself
too much, he should be made to trot these four or five Steps rather
than walk; after this make him rise again, and continue this Lesson for
some Days.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> he is so far advanced as to comprehend and understand
this sufficiently, begin by putting him to make a <i>Pesade</i>, demand
then a <i>Leap</i>, and finish by letting him make two <i>Pesades</i> together.
There are two things to be observ'd, which are very essential in this
Lesson; one, that when he is to make the Leap he should not rise so
high before as when he makes <i>Pesades</i> only, that so he may yerk out
with greater Ease and Liberty; the other Caution is always to make your
last <i>Pesade</i> longer and higher than the other, in order to prevent
your Horse from making any irregular Motions by shuffling about his
Legs, if he should be angry and impatient, as well as to keep him in a
more exact Obedience; and to make him light, if he is naturally heavy
and loaded in his Fore-parts, or apt to lean too much upon the Hand.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Again</span>, reduce the fourth <i>Pesade</i> into a Leap, as you did the
first; then make two <i>Pesades</i> following, and after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span> this let him walk
quietly four or five Steps, that he may make again the same Number of
<i>Pesades</i>, and in the same Order. In proportion as the Horse begins to
understand, and is able to execute these Lessons, you should augment
likewise the Leaps one by one, without hurrying or changing the Order,
making always between the Leaps a single <i>Pesade</i>, but lower than those
in the first Lesson; and then two more again after the last Leap,
sufficiently <i>high</i>. By degrees the Horse will grow active and light
in his Hind-parts, you must raise him then higher before, and support
him longer in the Air, in order to make him form the Leaps perfect, by
means of prudent and judicious Rules, often practised and repeated.
If your Horse forces the Hand, or presses forward more than you would
have him, either from Heaviness of Make, or from having too much Fire
in his Temper; in this case you should oblige him to make the <i>Pesades</i>
in the same Place, without stirring from it; and instead of letting
him advance four or five Steps, you should make him go backwards as
many. This Correction will cure him of the Habit of pressing forward,
and forcing the Hand. Upon this Occasion likewise you should use a
Hand-spur to prick his Croupe, instead of a Switch.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">To</span> make this Air just and perfect, it is necessary that the
Action of the Leap be finish'd as in the <i>Caprioles</i>, except that it
ought to be more <i>extended</i>, and the <i>Pesade</i> which is made between the
two Leaps should be changed into a <i>Time</i> of a quick and short Gallop;
that is, the two Hind-feet ought to follow the Fore-feet, together in
a quick Time and briskly, as in <i>Curvets</i> in the <i>Mezair</i>; but in this
the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span> Horse should advance more, not be so much <i>together</i>, nor rise so
high.</p>

<p><i>The</i> Perfection of this <i>Time</i> of the Gallop depends upon the Justness
of the Horseman's Motions.&mdash;They ought to be infinitely more exact
in this Lesson, than in the Caprioles, or any other Airs, which are
performed strait forward.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> reality, if the Horseman is too slow, and don't catch the
exact Time which parts the two Leaps, the Leap which follows will be
without any Spring or Vigour, because the Animal so restrain'd and held
back, can never extend himself, or put forth his Strength; if he don't
support and raise his Shoulders sufficiently high, the Croupe will then
be higher than it ought to be; and this Disproportion will force the
Horse to toss up his Nose, or make some other bad Motion with his Head
as he is coming to the Ground in his Leap; or else it will happen that
the succeeding Time will be so precipitate, that the next Leap will
be false and imperfect, as the Horse will not be sufficiently united,
but will be too heavy and lean upon the Hand.&mdash;If he is not together,
the Leap will be too much extended, and consequently weak and loose,
because the Horse will not be able to collect his Strength, in order to
make it equal to the first.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Learn</span> then in a few Words what should be the Horseman's Seat,
and what Actions he should use in this Lesson.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span><span class="smcap">He</span> should never force, alter, or lose the true <i>Apuy</i>, either
in raising, supporting, holding in, or driving forward his Horse.&mdash;His
Head should be not only firm and steady, but it is indispensably
necessary that his Seat should be exactly strait and just; for since
the Arm is an Appendix of the Body, it is certain that if the Motions
of the Horse shake or disorder the Body of the Rider, the Bridle-hand
must inevitably be shook, and consequently the true Apuy destroy'd.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> this Attitude then approach the Calves of your Legs,
support and hold your Horse up with your Hand, and when the Fore-part
is at its due Height, aid with the Switch upon the Croupe.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">If</span> your Horse rises before, keep your Body strait and firm; if
he lifts or tosses up his Croupe, or yerks out, fling your Shoulders
back without turning your Head to one side or the other, continuing the
Action of the Hand that holds the Switch.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Remember</span> that all the Motions of your Body should be so neat
and fine as to be imperceptible; as to what is the most graceful Action
for the Switch-hand, that over the Shoulder is thought the best; but
then this Shoulder must not be more back than the other; and care must
be taken that the Motion be quick and neat, and that the Horse do not
see it so plainly as to be alarm'd.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">I have</span> said, that when the Horse made his Leaps too <i>long</i>
and <i>extended</i>, you should then aid with your Hand-spur;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span> and for
this Reason, because the Hand-spur will make the Horse raise his
Croupe without advancing, as the Effect of the Switch will be to raise
the Croupe, and drive the Horse forward at the same time; it should
therefore be used to such Horses as retain themselves.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Remember</span> that you should never be extreme with your Horse,
and work him beyond his Strength and Ability; indeed one should never
ask of a Horse above half of what he can do; for if you work him till
he grows languid and tired, and his Strength and Wind fail him, you
will be compell'd to give your Aids roughly and openly; and when that
happens, neither the Rider or the Horse can appear with Brilliancy and
Grace.</p>
